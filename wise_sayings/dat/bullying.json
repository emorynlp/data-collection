      "cite": "Robin Sacredfire",
      "quote": "There is something very interesting about bullies that make them special. You see, a bully is a coward; the bully is terribly afraid of the world around him, and he can't stop himself from being in fear all the time. It is something organic that he can't control. That is why the bully seems to have no discipline and never listen to authority or authoritarian commands."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Robin Sacredfire",
      "quote": "Now, another very interesting thing about the bully is that, as he is a coward, he needs to erase this feeling of panic of the world, by regaining control over reality. And the only way to do this is by picking the weakest link he can find, that is, the one who will not fight back, the safer victim around."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Robin Sacredfire",
      "quote": "Actually, the bully enjoys public performances of his cowardice the most, because that is how he feeds his very little ego and very weak personality. That is the only thing that makes his life worthy, for the bully has no sense of self-worth and often considers himself unworthy. As a matter of fact, the bullies who think they don't deserve to be alive, are the ones telling others to kill themselves."

      "cite": "Theodore Roosevelt",

      "cite": "Charles Djou",
