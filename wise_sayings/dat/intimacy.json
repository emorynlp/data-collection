      "cite": "Robert Grudin",
      "quote": "True intimacy is a human constant. People of all types find it equally hard to achieve, equally precious to hold. Age, education, social status, make little difference here; even genius does not presuppose the talent to reveal one's self completely and completely absorb one's self in another personality. Intimacy is to love what concentration is to work: a simultaneous drawing together to attention and release of energy."

    {
      "cite": "Jane Austen",
      "quote": "It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;\u2014it is disposition alone. Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven days are more than enough for others."
    },
    {
      "cite": "John O'Donohue",
      "quote": "Real intimacy is a sacred experience. It never exposes its secret trust and belonging to the voyeuristic eye of a neon culture. Real intimacy is of the soul, and the soul is reserved."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Bertrand Russell",
      "quote": "Those who have never known the deep intimacy and the intense companionship of mutual love have missed the best thing that life has to give."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Geneen Roth",
      "quote": "Intimacy is not something that just happens between two people; it is a way of being alive. At every moment, we are choosing either to reveal ourselves or to protect ourselves, to value ourselves or to diminish ourselves, to tell the truth or to hide. To dive into life or to avoid it. Intimacy is making the choice to be connected to, rather than isolated from, our deepest truth at that moment."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Karen J. Prager",
      "quote": "The promise of intimacy is also its risk: the more intimacy two people share, the more power they give to each other to cause hurt."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Eliza Ryves",
      "quote": "From the covenants of intimacy, we enjoy the treasures of real friendship, for there can be no intimacy where there is no faith."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Marianne Williamson",
      "quote": "Real intimacy; real love has to do with a joining of the mind, a joining of the spirit, a joining of the heart."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Alice Fulton",
      "quote": "At least embarrasement is not an imitation. It is intimacy for beginners."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Cheryl Strayed",
      "quote": "The story of human intimacy is one of constantly allowing ourselves to see those we love most deeply in a new, more fractured light. Look hard. Risk that."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Parker J. Palmer",
      "quote": "The highest form of love is the love that allows for intimacy without the annihilation of difference."
    },

      "cite": "Patricia Love",
      "quote": "The deepest moments of intimacy occur when you're not talking."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Donald Miller",
      "quote": "If honesty is the key to intimacy, it means we don't have to be perfect and we don't have to pretend to be perfect."
    },
    {
      "cite": "David Deida",
      "quote": "The whole point of an intimacy is to serve each other in growth and love, hopefully in better ways than we can serve ourselves.  Otherwise, why engage in intimacy if your growth and love are served more by living alone?  Intimacy is about growing more than you could by yourself, through the art of mutual gifting."

      "quote": "Physical intimacy isn\u2019t and can never be an effective substitute for emotional intimacy."
