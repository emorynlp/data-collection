      "cite": "Muhammad Yunus",
      "quote": "UN studies conducted in more than forty developing countries show that the birth rate falls as women gain equality...

Family planning should be left to the family."

    {
      "cite": "Shirley Chisholm",
      "quote": "Which is more like genocide, I have asked some of my black brothers\u2014this, the way things are, or the conditions I am fighting for in which the full range of family planning services is available to women of all classes and colors, starting with effective contraception and extending to safe, legal terminations of undesired pregnancies at a price they can afford?"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Jeanne Shaheen",
      "quote": "We know that the way to decrease unplanned pregnancies and abortions is to make birth control and family planning services accessible and affordable, not micromanage the type of medical information and reproductive health counseling that women around the world receive."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Mother Teresa",
      "quote": "The way to plan the family is natural family planning, not contraception...This (use of contraceptives) turns the attention to self and so it destroys the gift of love in him or her. In loving, the husband and wife must turn the attention to each other as happens in natural family planning, and not to self, as happens in contraception. Once that living love is destroyed by contraception, abortion follows easily . . . And abortion, which often follows from contraception, brings a people to be spiritually poor, and that is the worst poverty and the most difficult to overcome."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Dr. Nafis Sadik",
      "quote": "When we talk about \u2018reproductive rights\u2019 this is what we mean. It\u2019s the difference between people as objects, and people as agents: between regarding people as pawns on the policy chessboard and recognizing them as the players, the decision-makers, the drivers of policy; autonomous individuals intimately concerned with the direction of their own lives. Under these conditions women, especially, enjoy better health and live fuller lives."

      "quote": "It is now quite lawful for a Catholic woman to avoid pregnancy by a resort to mathematics, though she is still forbidden to resort to physics and chemistry."

      "quote": "World fertility surveys indicate that anywhere from one third to one half of the babies born in the Third World would not be if their mothers had access to cheap, reliable family planning, had enough personal empowerment to stand up to their husbands and relatives, and could choose their own family size."

      "cite": "Rachel Silverman",
      "quote": "Family planning saves the lives of mothers and children. It empowers women with the right to make their own reproductive choices and control their own bodies. Through those choices, it empowers women to enter the workforce and pursue economic opportunities."

    },
    {
      "cite": "David Horsey",
      "quote": "From China and India to Turkey and Brazil, when women have gotten access to education, to family planning and to a vital place in the economy, greater prosperity has followed. And when women are free to speak and learn, they temper the extremes of ideology and fanaticism and raise sons who are less likely to become human bombs."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Bob Casey",
      "quote": "The evidence is pretty strong: if you have access to family planning and birth control, the abortion rate is going to go down."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Emily Sullivan",
      "quote": "When you don\u2019t have the ability to plan for your future, unfortunately, there are kids . . . who are in a situation where their parents are really not able to take care of them, and they end up in a system that, despite trying, can really fail them in the long run."

      "cite": "Anne Lamott",
      "quote": "As a Christian and a feminist, the most important message I can carry and fight for is the sacredness of each human life, and reproductive rights for all women are a crucial part of that. It is a moral necessity that we not be forced to bring children into the world for whom we cannot be responsible and adoring and present. We must not inflict life on children who will be resented; we must not inflict unwanted children on society."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Pamela Madsen",
