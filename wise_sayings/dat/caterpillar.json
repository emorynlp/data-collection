      "cite": "George E. Vaillant",
      "quote": "It is all too common for\u00c2\u00a0caterpillars to become butterflies and then to maintain that in their youth they had been little butterflies. Maturation makes liars of us all."

      "cite": "Pochassic",
      "quote": "A caterpillar builds a coffin, a butterfly remembers a cocoon"

      "cite": "Lorna Jackie Wilson",
      "quote": "As the\u00c2\u00a0caterpillar\u00c2\u00a0undergoes transformation within the cocoon before emerging as a butterfly; likewise, life experiences shape character."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Michael Beckwith",
      "quote": "When a caterpillar spins its cocoon, it goes through a transformative process and then emerges as a butterfly. Similarly, when we go through a practice of meditation and prayer, we loosen our egoic grip on a sense of self that is separate from the Whole and become vehicles of the emergent evolutionary paradigm of love, peace , compassion, wisdom, harmony and oneness that seeks expression on the planet."

    {
      "cite": "Stephanie Pace Marshall",
      "quote": "Adding wings to\u00c2\u00a0caterpillars does not create butterflies. It creates awkward and dysfunctional\u00c2\u00a0caterpillars. Butterflies are created through transformation."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Robert Kagan",
      "quote": "If a caterpillar doesn't know its future has wings, it hardly experiences itself as land-bound."

      "quote": "When a caterpillar bursts from its cocoon and discovers it has wings, it does not sit idly, hoping to one day turn back. It flies."

      "quote": "It is in being the caterpillar that you become the butterfly."

      "cite": "Anton Chekhov",
      "quote": "In nature a repulsive caterpillar turns into a lovely butterfly. But with human beings it is the other way round: a lovely butterfly turns into a repulsive caterpillar."

    {
      "cite": "Lorna Jackie Wilson",
      "quote": "As the\u00c2\u00a0caterpillar\u00c2\u00a0undergoes transformation and emerges as a butterfly; likewise, character undergoes transformation through experiences, aspirations and beliefs. How will you emerge?"
    },
    {
      "cite": "John Harricharan",
      "quote": "The\u00c2\u00a0caterpillar\u00c2\u00a0dies so the butterfly could be born. And, yet, the\u00c2\u00a0caterpillar\u00c2\u00a0lives in the butterfly and they are but one. So, when I die, it will be that I have been transformed from the\u00c2\u00a0caterpillar\u00c2\u00a0of earth to the butterfly of the universe."

      "quote": "The\u00c2\u00a0caterpillar\u00c2\u00a0turns to liquid before turning into a butterfly. Liquid. Thus washing away any speck of his\u00c2\u00a0caterpillar\u00c2\u00a0self as he lies completely vulnerable to his environment in his chrysalis shell. One good solid gust of wind and the\u00c2\u00a0caterpillars boned."
