      "cite": "Dalai Lama",
      "quote": "Politicians need religion even more than a hermit in retreat. If a hermit acts out of bad motivation, he harms no one but himself. But if someone who can directly influence the whole of society acts with bad motivation, then a great number of people will be adversely affected."

    {
      "cite": "Judith Martin",
      "quote": "Etiquette is all human social behavior. If you're a hermit on a mountain, you don't have to worry about etiquette; if somebody comes up the mountain, then you've got a problem. It matters because we want to live in reasonably harmonious communities."

      "quote": "Far in a wild, unknown to public view, From youth to age a reverend hermit grew; The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell, His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well, Remote from man, with God he pass'd the days; Prayer all his business, all his pleasure praise."

      "cite": "Choi Joon-ho",
      "quote": "A hermit, aware of such unworldly joy, finds truth from scenes of rock walls, sunset glow, mountain caves and clouds. ... A decent person needs to empty his heart for room for newly realized truth as well as to fill his heart at the same time, leaving no room for worldly desires."
