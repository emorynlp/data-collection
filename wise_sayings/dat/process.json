      "cite": "Saul D. Alinsky",
      "quote": "Process tells us how. Purpose tells us why. But in reality, it is academic to draw a line between them, they are part of a continuum.

The very process of democratic participation is for the purpose of organization rather than to rid the alleys of dirt. Process is really purpose."

      "quote": "Sometimes we make the process more complicated than we need to. We will never make a journey of a thousand miles by fretting about how long it will take or how hard it will be. We make the journey by taking each day step by step and then repeating it again and again until we reach our destination."
