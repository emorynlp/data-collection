    {
      "cite": "Jennifer James",
      "quote": "Jealousy is simply and clearly the fear that you do not have value. Jealousy scans for evidence to prove the point - that others will be preferred and rewarded more than you. There is only one alternative - self-value. If you cannot love yourself, you will not believe that you are loved. You will always think it's a mistake or luck. Take your eyes off others and turn the scanner within. Find the seeds of your jealousy, clear the old voices and experiences. Put all the energy into building your personal and emotional security. Then you will be the one others envy, and you can remember the pain and reach out to them."

      "cite": "Margaret Mead",
      "quote": "Jealousy is not a barometer by which the depth of love can be read, it merely records the degree of the lover's insecurity."

    {
      "cite": "Arthur Lynch",
      "quote": "Jealousy is one of the wickedest of all the passions. It is that which has been the most fruitful mother of tragedies, murders, and wars. But reprehensible though it is, jealousy is almost rather to be pitied than blamed--its first victims are those who harbour the feeling."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Emma Goldman",
      "quote": "Jealousy is indeed a poor medium to secure love, but it is a secure medium to destroy one's self-respect. For jealous people, like dope-fiends, stoop to the lowest level and in the end inspire only disgust and loathing."

    {
      "cite": "Francois de la Rochefoucauld",
      "quote": "Jealousy lives upon doubts. It becomes madness or ceases entirely as soon as we pass from doubt to certainty."

    {
      "cite": "William Penn",
      "quote": "Jealousy is a kind of civil war in the soul, where judgment and imagination are at perpetual jars. This civil dissension in the mind, like that of the body politic, commits great disorders, and lays all waste. Nothing stands safe in its way; Nature, interest, religion, must yield to its fury. It violates contracts, dissolves society, breaks wedlock, betrays friends and neighbours. No body is good, and every one is either doing or designing them a mischief. It has a venom that more or less rankles wherever it bites: And as it reports fancies or facts, so it disturbs its own house as often as other folks."

      "cite": "Robert A. Heinlein",
      "quote": "A competent and self-confident person is incapable of jealousy in anything. Jealousy is invariably a symptom of neurotic insecurity."

    {
      "cite": "Aristotle",
      "quote": "Jealousy is both reasonable and belongs to reasonable men, while envy is base and belongs to the base, for the one makes himself get good things by jealousy, while the other does not allow his neighbour to have them through envy."

    {
      "cite": "Milan Kundera",
