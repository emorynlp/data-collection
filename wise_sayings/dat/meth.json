      "quote": "Methamphetamine: the quintessential American drug. American housewives, heads of state, businessmen and poets alike have acquired a taste for the yellow, crystalline powder. Everyone from Hitler to President Kennedy to Elvis to Jack Kerouac indulged in one of its many forms, and its presence has been an invisible hand shaping events, preparing the ground for the strangest drug epidemic the world has ever seen."

      "cite": "Sarah Holder",
      "quote": "The consumer landscape...is automatically the perfect context for the production of meth...Alone, aluminum foil, camping stoves, Gatorade bottles, salsa jars, and cold tablets are just domestic objects; together, they are transformed into agents of chaos."

      "cite": "Erica Haas",
      "quote": "It\u2019s like God tells you that if you take another breath, your children will die. You do everything you can not to take a breath. But eventually you do. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like. Your brain just screams at you."
