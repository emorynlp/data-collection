A person lost can have hope of being found, but false hope, a hope that can torture a soul with promises never delivered, that is a hope we can all live without."

    {
      "cite": "Juliet Marillier",
      "quote": "Hope is such a tenuous quality. To feel it and then to be denied what one most longs for. Better, surely, not to hope at all, than to open the heart to a hope that is impossible."
