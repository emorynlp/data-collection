      "quote": "He is not seeking a powerful people to represent Him. Rather, He looks for all those who are weak, foolish, despised, and written off: and He inhabits them with His own strength."

    {
      "cite": "John Macarthur",
      "quote": "You are the only Bible some unbelievers will ever read, and your life is under scrutiny every day. What do others learn from you? Do they see an accurate picture of your God?"

    {
      "cite": "Rev. Billy Graham",
      "quote": "We are the Bibles the world is reading; we are the creeds the world is needing; we are the sermons the world is heeding."

      "cite": "Charles Colson",
      "quote": "Taking the gospel to people wherever they are\u2014death row, the ghetto, or next door\u2014is frontline evangelism. Frontline love. It is our one hope for breaking down barriers and for restoring the sense of community, of caring for one another, that our decadent, impersonalized culture has sucked out of us."

    {
      "cite": "Dwight L. Moody",
      "quote": "We are told to let our light shine, and if it does, we won't need to tell anybody it does. Lighthouses don't fire cannons to call attention to their shining- they just shine."

    {
      "cite": "John Macarthur",
      "quote": "One thing I have observed in all my years of ministry is that the most effective and important aspects of evangelism usually take place on an individual, personal level. Most people do not come to Christ as an immediate response to a sermon they hear in a crowded setting. They come to Christ because of the influence of an individual."

      "cite": "D. Elton Trueblood",
      "quote": "Evangelism is not a professional job for a few trained men, but is instead the unrelenting responsibility of every person who belongs to the company of Jesus."
    },
    {
      "cite": "C. S. Lewis",
      "quote": "The Church exists for nothing else but to draw men into Christ, to make them little Christs. If they are not doing that, all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible itself, are simply a waste of time. God became Man for no other purpose."
    },
    {
      "cite": "David Platt",
      "quote": "We email, Facebook, tweet and text with people who are going to spend eternity in either heaven or hell. Our lives are too short to waste on mere temporal conversations when massive eternal realities hang in the balance. Just as you and I have no guarantee that we will live through the day, the people around us are not guaranteed tomorrow either. So let's be intentional about sewing the threads of the gospel into the fabric of our conversations every day, knowing that it will not always be easy, yet believing that eternity will always be worth it."

    {
      "cite": "J. Howard Edington",
      "quote": "People who don't believe in missions have not read the New Testament. Right from the beginning Jesus said the field is the world. The early church took Him at His word and went East, West, North and South."

    {
      "cite": "Curry R. Blake",
      "quote": "If your Gospel isn't touching others, it hasn't touched  you!"

      "cite": "Oswald J. Smith",
      "quote": "No one has the right to hear the gospel twice, while there remains someone who has not heard it once."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Joni Eareckson Tada",
      "quote": "Nothing will convince and convict those around us like the peaceful and positive way you and I respond to our twentieth century hurts and distress. The unbelieving world\u2014your neighbors, the guy at the gas station, the postman, the lady at the cleaners, your boss at work\u2014is observing the way we undergo our trials."
    },
    {
      "cite": "David Wilkerson",
      "quote": "God uses people. God uses people to perform His work. He does not send angels. Angels weep over it, but God does not use angels to accomplish His purposes. He uses burdened broken-hearted weeping men and women."

      "cite": "Oswald Chambers",
      "quote": "God is not saving the world; it is done. Our business is to get men and women to realize it."

      "cite": "Augustine of Hippo",
      "quote": "Run to and fro everywhere, holy fires, beautiful fires; for you are the light of the world, nor are you put under a bushel. He whom you cleave unto is exalted, and has exalted you. Run to and fro, and be known unto all nations."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Scott Hahn",
      "quote": "New Evangelization is the work of the whole Church \u2014 lay, ordained, and consecrated. It\u2019s about friends, family, and co-workers reaching out to one another and proclaiming the truth of Christ using all available means \u2014 conversation, personal witness, media, and the vast array of intellectual and spiritual riches the Church has built up in her two-thousand-year history. It\u2019s about simple acts of kindness, simple challenges issued in love, and simple questions asked with sincerity. More fundamentally, the New Evangelization is more for the baptized than the unbaptized. It\u2019s for those who\u2019ve been inadequately catechized but all too adequately secularized, and it\u2019s for those who\u2019ve been de-Christianized in the very process of being sacramentalized."

    {
      "cite": "Pope Francis",
      "quote": "We have to go out and talk to people in the city who we've seen on their balconies. We have to come out of our shell and tell them that Jesus lives... to say it with joy...even though it seems a little crazy sometimes."
    },
    {
      "cite": "William Lane Craig",
      "quote": "Successful evangelism involves not only harvesting, but sowing and watering, too. We must never think that because a nonbeliever remained unconvinced by our case that our apologetic has failed. For one encounter is not the end of the story."

    {
      "cite": "Bishop Robert Barron",
      "quote": "Christianity is not a set of private convictions that we cultivate inwardly or whisper among ourselves. It is the message that the whole world needs to hear. We who have heard it must become agents of subversion and transformation."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Lee Strobel",
      "quote": "I've seen far too many Christians who are more than willing to travel halfway around the world to volunteer for a week in an orphanage, but who cannot bring themselves to take the personal risk of sharing Jesus with the co-worker who sits day after day in the cubicle right next to them."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Matt Diaz",
      "quote": "We Christians sometimes think we need a plan for evangelism. I don't think Jesus had an evangelism plan. I think He just interacted with the people He came into contact with."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Mark Dever",
      "quote": "The news that we, as Christians, have to bring is so great, so tremendous, not only because our depravity is so pervasive and our sin so widespread, but also because God\u2019s plans for us are so different, so wonderful."

    {
      "cite": "Richard Halverson",
      "quote": "Evangelism is not salesmanship. It is not urging people, pressing them, coercing them, overwhelming them, or subduing them. Evangelism is telling a message. Evangelism is reporting good news."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Pope Benedict XVI",
