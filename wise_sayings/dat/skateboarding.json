      "quote": "Skateboarding is not a hobby. And it is not a sport. Skateboarding is a way of learning how to redefine the world around you. For most people, when they saw a swimming pool, they thought, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLet's take a swim.' But I thought, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLet's ride it.' When they saw the curb or a street, they would think about driving on it. I would think about the texture. I slowly developed the ability to look at the world through totally different means."

Every time I see those skateboard kids, I think 'those kids'll be alright.'"
