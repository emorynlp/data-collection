      "quote": "In depression this faith in deliverance, in ultimate restoration, is absent. The pain is unrelenting, and what makes the condition intolerable is the foreknowledge that no remedy will come \u2014 not in a day, an hour, a month, or a minute . . . And this results in a striking experience \u2014 one which I have called, borrowing military terminology, the situation of the walking wounded."

      "cite": "William Styron",
      "quote": "The gray drizzle of horror induced by depression takes on the quality of physical pain. But it is not an immediately identifiable pain, like that of a broken limb. It may be more accurate to say that despair, owing to some evil trick played upon the sick brain by the inhabiting psyche, comes to resemble the diabolical discomfort of being imprisoned in a fiercely overheated room. And because no breeze stirs this caldron, because there is no escape from this smothering confinement, it is entirely natural that the victim begins to think ceaselessly of oblivion."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Mikhail Bulgakov",
      "quote": "Everything passes away \u2014 suffering, pain, blood, hunger, pestilence. The sword will pass away too, but the stars will still remain when the shadows of our presence and our deeds have vanished from the earth. There is no man who does not know that. Why, then, will we not turn our eyes toward the stars? Why?"

      "cite": "Andrew Solomon",
      "quote": "My depression had grown on me as that vine had conquered the oak; it had been a sucking thing that had wrapped itself around me, ugly and more alive than I. It had had a life of its own that bit by bit asphyxiated all of my life out of me. At the worst stage of major depression, I had moods that I knew were not my moods: they belonged to the depression, as surely as the leaves on that tree's high branches belonged to the vine."

I felt myself sagging under what was much stronger than I; first I could not use my ankles, and then I could not control my knees, and then my waist began to break under the strain, and then my shoulders turned in, and in the end I was compacted and fetal, depleted by this thing that was crushing me without holding me. Its tendrils threatened to pulverize my mind and my courage and my stomach, and crack my bones and desiccate my body. It went on glutting itself on me when there seemed nothing left to feed it."
    },

      "cite": "William Shakespeare",

    {
      "cite": "William Wordsworth",
      "quote": "It gives, to think that our immortal being / No more shall need such garments; and yet man, / As long as he shall be the child of earth, / Might almost 'weep to have' what he may lose, / Nor be himself extinguished, but survive, / Abject, depressed, forlorn, disconsolate."
