      "cite": "Matthieu Ricard",
      "quote": "If you don't have\u00a0altruism, inner strength, inner peace, attention, then it's a trauma. It makes a difficult life for you and for others."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Thomas Nagel",
      "quote": "Altruism\u00a0itself depends on a recognition of the reality of other persons, and on the equivalent capacity to regard oneself as merely one individual among many."

    {
      "cite": "Ilona Andrews",
      "quote": "At the core, our motives are always self-serving, Kate.\u00a0Altruism\u00a0is a fog created by sly minds seeking to benefit from the energy and skill of others. Nothing more."

      "cite": "Jon Weber",

As human beings, our purpose is to live meaningful lives, to develop a warm heart. There is meaning in being everyone's friend. The real source of peace amongst our families, friends and neighbours is love and compassion."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Frank Prochaska",
      "quote": "Which is more subversive-and corrosive-to believe in altruism or to see it simply as a cloak of self interest? Even if altruism did not exist, it would be necessary to believe in it. Pessimists in power are prone to despotism."
