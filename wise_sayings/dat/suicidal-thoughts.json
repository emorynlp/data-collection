      "cite": "Susanna Kaysen",
      "quote": "Suicide is a form of murder - premeditated murder. It isn't something you do the first time you think of doing it. It takes getting used to. And you need the means, the opportunity, the motive. A successful suicide demands good organization and a cool head, both of which are usually incompatible with the suicidal state of mind."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Gerard Way",
      "quote": "Suicide is a serious thing. And if you know anyone who is suicidal, you need to get them help. No one should be in pain. Everyone should love themselves."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Albert Camus",
      "quote": "But in the end one needs more courage to live than to kill himself."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Tiffanie DeBartolo",
      "quote": "Did you really want to die? No one commits suicide because they want to die. Then why do they do it? Because they want to stop the pain."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Linda Lee Landon",
      "quote": "Suicide creates a monstrous emotional upsurge of shame and guilt. Everyone participates in feeling responsible and even shamed at knowing the suicidal candidate. If these feelings are not healed the vampire of suicidal death can strike again and again."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Arthur Schopenhauer",
      "quote": "Suicide may also be regarded as an experiment -- a question which man puts to Nature, trying to force her to answer. The question is this: What change will death produce in a man's existence and in his insight into the nature of things? It is a clumsy experiment to make; for it involves the destruction of the very consciousness which puts the question and awaits the answer."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Stanley Hauerwas",
      "quote": "From the perspective of the one committing suicide, his or her act can be one of the most perverse forms of moral manipulation, as it abandons those left behind to their shame, guilt, and grief. Suicide is something like a metaphysical \"I gotcha!\" It is often an attempt to kill or wound others."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Charles Caleb",
      "quote": "Suicide sometimes proceeds from cowardice, but not always; for cowardice sometimes prevents it; since as many live because they are afraid to die, as die because they are afraid to live"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Richard Bach",
      "quote": "Anyone desperate enough for suicide...should be desperate enough to go to creative extremes to solve problems: elope at midnight, stow away on the boat to New Zealand and start over, do what they always wanted to do but were afraid to try."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Ashley Purdy",
      "quote": "You think suicide is cowardly? I'll tell you what's cowardly. Hurting someone so much that they think ending their lives is the only way to make it better."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Cyril Connolly",
      "quote": "There are many who dare not kill themselves for fear of what the neighbors will say."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Vaclav Havel",
      "quote": "Sometimes I wonder if suicides aren't in fact sad guardians of the meaning of life."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Jeffrey Eugenides",
      "quote": "We couldn't imagine the emptiness of a creature who put a razor to her wrists and opened her veins, the emptiness and the calm."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Phil Donahue",
      "quote": "Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Author Unknown",
      "quote": "I just couldn't live with myself knowing I had just killed myself."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Chuck Palahniuk",
      "quote": "You have a choice. Live or die. Every breath is a choice. Every minute is a choice. To be or not to be."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Albert Camus",
      "quote": "All healthy men have thought of their own suicide."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Glennon Doyle Melton",
      "quote": "We are all that girl on the bathroom floor. Rock bottom just means crisis. It is not the end. Life does not evict us from anything unless it's inviting us to something better."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Barack Obama",
      "quote": "To anyone out there who's hurting\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit's not a sign of weakness to ask for help. It's a sign of strength."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Charlotte Eriksson",
      "quote": "Take a shower, wash off the day. Drink a glass of water. Make the room dark. Lie down and close your eyes. Notice the silence. Notice your heart. Still beating. Still fighting. You made it, after all. You made it, another day. And you can make it one more. You're doing just fine."
