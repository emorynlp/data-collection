      "quote": "A lot of people experience the world with the same incredulity as when a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat.\u2026We know that the world is not all sleight of hand and deception because we are in it, we are part of it. Actually we are the white rabbit being pulled out of the hat. The only difference beween us and the white rabbit is that the rabbit does not realize it is taking part in a magic trick."

      "quote": "We are such spendthrifts with our lives, the trick of living is to slip on and off the planet with the least fuss you can muster. I\u2019m not running for sainthood. I just happen to think that in life we need to be a little like the farmer, who puts back into the soil what he takes out."

    {
      "cite": "Chuck Palahniuk",
      "quote": "The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close-up. The shortcut to closing a door is to bury yourself in the details. This is how we must look to God. As if everything's just fine."

    {
      "cite": "Rebekah Crane",
      "quote": "The longer I lie, the worse it gets. That's the truth about lies - when they linger, they slowly trick you into believing they're the truth."

      "cite": "Gabriel Garcia Marquez",
