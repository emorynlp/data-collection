      "cite": "Stephen Hawking",
      "quote": "Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks."

    {
      "cite": "Sam Altman",
      "quote": "AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there'll be great companies."

      "cite": "Fei-Fei Li",
      "quote": "AI is everywhere. It's not that big, scary thing in the future. AI is here with us."

      "cite": "Judy Woodruff",
      "quote": "You may not realize it, but artificial intelligence is all around us."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Jean Baudrillard",
      "quote": "The sad thing about artificial intelligence is that it lacks artifice and therefore intelligence."

    {
      "cite": "Douglas Hofstadter",

      "cite": "Tom Chatfield",
      "quote": "Forget artificial intelligence \u2013 in the brave new world of big data, it\u2019s artificial idiocy we should be looking out for."

      "cite": "Diane Ackerman",
      "quote": "Artificial intelligence is growing up fast, as are robots whose facial expressions can elicit empathy and make your mirror neurons quiver."
    },

      "cite": "Alan Kay",
      "quote": "Some people worry that artificial intelligence will make us feel inferior, but then, anybody in his right mind should have an inferiority complex every time he looks at a flower."

    {
      "cite": "Paul Davies",
      "quote": "The development of artificial intelligence may well imply that man will relinquish his intellectual supremacy in favor of thinking machines. With oceans of time available for future innovation, there seems to be no reason why machines cannot achieve and surpass anything of which the human brain is capable."

    {
      "cite": "Andrew Ng",
      "quote": "It is difficult to think of a major industry that AI will not transform. This includes healthcare, education, transportation, retail, communications, and agriculture. There are surprisingly clear paths for AI to make a big difference in all of these industries."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Astro Teller",
      "quote": "The real goal of AI is to understand and build devices that can perceive, reason, act, and learn at least as well as we can."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Andrew Ng",
      "quote": "AI has been making tremendous progress in machine translation, self-driving cars, etc. Basically, all the progress I see is in specialised intelligence. It might be hundreds or thousands of years or, if there is an unexpected breakthrough, decades."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Oren Etzioni",
      "quote": "AI is neither good nor evil. It's a tool. It's a technology for us to use."

      "quote": "AI will impact every industry on Earth, including manufacturing, agriculture, health care, and more."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Fei-Fei Li",
      "quote": "Making AI more sensitive to the full scope of human thought is no simple task. The solutions are likely to require insights derived from fields beyond computer science, which means programmers will have to learn to collaborate more often with experts in other domains."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Vivienne Ming",
      "quote": "AI might be a powerful technology, but things won't get better simply by adding AI."

      "cite": "Marvin Minsky",
      "quote": "Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by men."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Godfried Danneels",
      "quote": "Artificial Intelligence leaves no doubt that it wants its audiences to enter a realm of pure fantasy when it identifies one of the last remaining islands of civilization as New Jersey."

    {
      "cite": "Arnold Schwarzenegger",
      "quote": "We are going in the direction of artificial intelligence or hybrid intelligence where a part of our brain will get information from the cloud and the other half is from you, so all this stuff will happen in the future."

    {
      "cite": "Andrew Ng",
      "quote": "Despite all the hype and excitement about AI, it's still extremely limited today relative to what human intelligence is."

    {
      "cite": "Donald Knuth",
      "quote": "AI has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires 'thinking' but has failed to do most of what people and animals do 'without thinking'-that, somehow, is much harder."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Stuart J. Russell",
      "quote": "AI's ability to recognize visual categories and images is now pretty close to what human beings can manage, and probably better than a lot of people's, actually. AI can have more knowledge of detailed categories, like animals and so on."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Larry Tesler",

      "cite": "Stuart J. Russell",
      "quote": "Most of the AI goes into figuring which are the important pages you want. And to some extent what your query means, and what you're likely to be after based on your previous behavior and other information it collects about you."
