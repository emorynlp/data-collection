      "cite": "Barack Obama",
      "quote": "The study of law can be disappointing at times, a matter of applying narrow rules and arcane procedure to an uncooperative reality; a sort of glorified accounting that serves to regulate the affairs of those who have power\u2014and that all too often seeks to explain, to those who do not, the ultimate wisdom and justness of their condition. But that's not all the law is. The law is also memory; the law also records a long-running conversation, a nation arguing with its conscience."

    {
      "cite": "Daniel R. White",
      "quote": "Law school has been described as a place for the accumulation of learning. First-year students bring some in; third-year students take none away. Hence it accumulates."

    {
      "cite": "Gerry Spence",
