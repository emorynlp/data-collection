    },
    {
      "cite": "Rev. Chas. A. Savage",
      "quote": "The Lord\u2019s Supper may be made more profitable for us if we emphasize it as a bond of brotherhood. A communion with Christ, it is also a communion with each other, and not only among the few gathered within the walls of a single sanctuary; it is the fellowship of the ages. In the name of our common Christ, 'encompassed by so great a cloud of witnesses,' we sit with them in heavenly places whenever we come to the Communion Table of our Lord."

      "cite": "Charles Haddon Spurgeon",
      "quote": "Communion is strength; solitude is weakness. Alone, the fine old beech yields to the blast and lies prone on the meadow. In the forest, supporting each other, the trees laugh at the hurricane. The sheep of Jesus flock together. The social element is the genius of Christianity."
    },
    {
      "cite": "St. Faustina",
      "quote": "Holy Communion assures me that I will win the victory; and so it is.  I fear the day when I do not receive Holy Communion.  The bread of the Strong gives me all the strength I need to carry on my mission and to do whatever the Lord asks of me."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Michael Youssef",
      "quote": "Whenever we receive Communion, we must do so in humility and brokenness before God. We must rejoice and be grateful and thankful for our salvation."

      "cite": "Henri Nouwen",
      "quote": "Jesus didn't say, 'Blessed are those who care for the poor.' He said, 'Blessed are we where we are poor, where we are broken.' It is there that God loves us deeply and pulls us into deeper communion with himself."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Pope Benedict XVI",
      "quote": "On the one hand, faith is a profoundly personal contact with God, which touches me in my innermost being and places me in front of the living God in absolute immediacy in such a way that I can speak with Him, love Him, and enter into communion with Him."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Gordon Brown",
      "quote": "I welcome the role that people of faith play in building Britain's future - and the Catholic communion in particular is to be congratulated for so often being the conscience of our country, for helping 'the least of these' even when bearing witness to the truth is hard or unpopular."
    },
    {
      "cite": "John LaFarge S.J.",
      "quote": "The Mass is the re-enactment of the cross\u2019s mighty onslaught upon human differences: the breaking down of the wall of partition. We participate in common, as in one family, in the holy Eucharistic offering. We are united with one another through our union with Jesus Christ in Communion."

    },
    {
      "cite": "C. E. Babb",
      "quote": "God, in giving us what we pray for because we pray, and in refusing to give what we fail to ask for, deals with us as a loving father. He cultivates that living sympathy and communion between our hearts and His own which is necessary to our happiness and growth in grace."
