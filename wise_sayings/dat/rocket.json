      "quote": "If there\u2019s a zeppelin, it\u2019s alternate history. If there\u2019s a rocketship, it\u2019s science fiction. If there are swords and/or horses, it\u2019s fantasy. A book with swords and horses in it can be turned into science fiction by adding a rocketship to the mix. If a book has a rocketship in it, the only thing that can turn it back into fantasy is the Holy Grail."
