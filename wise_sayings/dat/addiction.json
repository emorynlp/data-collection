      "cite": "William Gibson",
      "quote": "Addictions ... started out like magical pets, pocket monsters. They did extraordinary tricks, showed you things you hadn't seen, were fun. But came, through some gradual dire alchemy, to make decisions for you. Eventually, they were making your most crucial life-decisions. And they were ... less intelligent than goldfish."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Moby",
      "quote": "What fascinates me about addiction and obsessive behavior is that people would choose an altered state of consciousness that's toxic and ostensibly destroys most aspects of your normal life, because for a brief moment you feel okay."

      "cite": "Mark Twain",
      "quote": "Quitting smoking is easy, I've done it hundreds of times."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Cornelius Platinga",
      "quote": "At every stage, addiction is driven by one of the most powerful, mysterious, and vital forces of human existence. What drives addiction is longing \u2014 a longing not just of brain, belly, or loins but finally of the heart."

      "cite": "Russell Brand",
      "quote": "The mentality and behavior of drug addicts and alcoholics is wholly irrational until you understand that they are completely powerless over their addiction and unless they have structured help, they have no hope."

    {
      "cite": "Edgar Allan Poe",
      "quote": "I have absolutely no pleasure in the stimulants in which I sometimes so madly indulge. It has not been in the pursuit of pleasure that I have periled life and reputation and reason. It has been the desperate attempt to escape from torturing memories, from a sense of insupportable loneliness and a dread of some strange impending doom."

      "cite": "Chuck Palahniuk",
      "quote": "I admire addicts. In a world where everybody is waiting for some blind, random disaster, or some sudden disease, the addict has the comfort of knowing what will most likely wait for him down the road. He's taken some control over his ultimate fate, and his addiction keeps the cause of death from being a total surprise."

    {
      "cite": "Alice Miller",
      "quote": "What is addiction, really? It is a sign, a signal, a symptom of distress. It is a language that tells us about a plight that must be understood."

      "cite": "Anonymous",
      "quote": "Addiction doesn't kill the addict. It kills the family, kids and people who tried to help!"

    },
    {
      "cite": "Dennis Daley",
      "quote": "Recovery from addiction requires hard work, a proper attitude and learning skills to stay sober, not drinking alcohol or using other drugs. Successful drug recovery or alcohol recovery involves changing attitudes, acquiring knowledge, and developing skills to meet the many challenges of sobriety."

      "cite": "Jean Church",
      "quote": "You can come out of the furnace of trouble two ways: if you let it consume you, you come out a cinder; but there is a kind of metal which refuses to be consumed, and comes out a star."

      "cite": "Ann D. Clark",
      "quote": "These feelings, no matter how painful, are part of living. Today, we are alive \u2013 not anesthetized, not sedated, not passed out. Take control of your feelings and through action you can change. Today, as every day of sober living, we have a choice."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Anne Clendening",
      "quote": "Addiction, at its worst, is akin to having Stockholm Syndrome. You\u2019re like a hostage who has developed an irrational affection for your captor. They can abuse you, torture you, even threaten to kill you, and you\u2019ll remain inexplicably and disturbingly loyal."

      "cite": "Brene Brown",
      "quote": "Understanding the difference between healthy striving and perfectionism is critical to laying down the shield and picking up your life. Research shows that perfectionism hampers success. In fact, it's often the path to depression, anxiety, addiction, and life paralysis."

      "quote": "People use drugs, legal and illegal, because their lives are intolerably painful or dull. They hate their work and find no rest in their leisure. They are estranged from their families and their neighbors. It should tell us something that in healthy societies drug use is celebrative, convivial, and occasional, whereas among us it is lonely, shameful, and addictive. We need drugs, apparently, because we have lost each other."

    {
      "cite": "William S. Burroughs",
      "quote": "Most addicts I have talked to report a similar experience. They did not start using drugs for any reason they can remember. They just drifted along until they got hooked. If you have never been addicted, you can have no clear idea what it means to need junk with the addict\u2019s special need. You don\u2019t decide to be an addict. One morning you wake up sick and you\u2019re an addict."
