All this makes your profession a veritable mission and makes you \u2018experts in humanity."

      "cite": "William Gay",
      "quote": "As dropping moisture on December flowers, / As sunlight breaking o'er the August plain, / As shines the Virgin on the midnight hours, / So is thy presence at the bed of pain; / And as the flowers revive to bloom more fair, /  And o'er the plain the wattles burst in fire, / And midnight hours to morn at last repair, / So hope and life thy minist'rings inspire; / And though for me there's but the life and hope / That lie abundant past the gates of Death, / Yet thither as with feeble steps I grope / Thy friendly arm assists my failing breath; / Nor will I deem of Providence the worse / Who sent me pain to send me thee for nurse."
