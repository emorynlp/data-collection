      "cite": "Albert Camus",
      "quote": "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest -- whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories -- comes afterward. These are games; one must first answer."

    {
      "cite": "David Hume",

    {
      "cite": "Emile Durkheim",
      "quote": "Each victim of suicide gives his act a personal stamp which expresses his temperament, the special conditions in which he is involved, and which, consequently, cannot be explained by the social and general causes of the phenomenon."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Graham Greene",
      "quote": "However great a man's fear of life, suicide remains the courageous act, the clear-headed act of a mathematician. The suicide has judged by the laws of chance -- so many odds against one that to live will be more miserable than to die. His sense of mathematics is greater than his sense of survival. But think how a sense of survival must clamor to be heard at the last moment, what excuses it must present of a totally unscientific nature."

    {
      "cite": "A. Alvarez",
      "quote": "No one is promiscuous in his way of dying. A man who has decided to hang himself will never jump in front of a train."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Dorothy Parker",
      "quote": "Razors pain you; rivers are damp; acids stain you; and drugs cause cramp. Guns aren't lawful; nooses give; gas smells awful; you might as well live."

    {
      "cite": "Robert Sanderson Mulliken",
      "quote": "I decided that life rationally considered seemed pointless and futile, but it is still interesting in a variety of ways, including the study of science. So why not carry on, following the path of scientific hedonism? Besides, I did not have the courage for the more rational procedure of suicide."
