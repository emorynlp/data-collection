      "cite": "Virginia Woolf",
      "quote": "While fame impedes and constricts, obscurity wraps about a man like a mist; obscurity is dark, ample, and free; obscurity lets the mind take its way unimpeded. Over the obscure man is poured the merciful suffusion of darkness. None knows where he goes or comes. He may seek the truth and speak it; he alone is free; he alone is truthful, he alone is at peace."

    {
      "cite": "Henri Frederic Amiel",
      "quote": "The obscure only exists that it may cease to exist. In it lies the opportunity of all victory and all progress. Whether it call itself fatality, death, night, or matter, it is the pedestal of life, of light, of liberty and the spirit. For it represents resistance -- that is to say, the fulcrum of all activity, the occasion for its development and its triumph."

      "cite": "Bernard Kelvin Clive",
      "quote": "One of the worse states to be in, is to be ignored. Obscurity like insecurity, kills!"

    },
    {
      "cite": "Quintilian",
      "quote": "The soul languishing in obscurity contracts a kind of rust, or abandons itself to the chimera of presumption; for it is natural for it to acquire something, even when separated from any one."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Alec Guinness",
      "quote": "I never knew how good it is to be unknown until now. The last time I was unknown I was too busy trying to become known to realize the advantages of obscurity."

    {
      "cite": "Edgar Allan Poe",
      "quote": "In one case out of a hundred a point is excessively discussed because it is obscure; in the ninety-nine remaining it is obscure because it is excessively discussed."

    {
      "cite": "Henry Miller",
      "quote": "The great work must inevitably be obscure, except to the very few, to those who like the author himself are initiated into the mysteries. Communication then is secondary: it is perpetuation which is important. For this only one good reader is necessary."

      "quote": "The first step to wisdom is to avoid the common fallacy which considers everything profound that is obscure."

      "cite": "Dorothy Parker",
      "quote": "I'm never going to accomplish anything; that's perfectly clear to me. I'm never going to be famous. My name will never be writ large on the roster of Those Who Do Things. I don't do anything. Not one single thing. I used to bite my nails, but I don't even do that any more."

    {
      "cite": "Samuel Johnson",
      "quote": "I would rather be attacked than unnoticed. For the worst thing you can do to an author is to be silent as to his works."

      "quote": "The idea of being forgotten is terrifying. I fear not just that I, personally, will be forgotten but that we are all doomed to being forgotten; that the sum of life is ultimately nothing; that we experience joy and disappointment and aches and delights and loss, make our little mark on the world, and then we vanish, and the mark is erased, and it is as if we never existed."

      "cite": "Charles Kingsley",
      "quote": "If I am ever obscure in my expressions, do not fancy that therefore I am deep. If I were really deep, all the world would understand, though they might not appreciate. The perfectly popular style is the perfectly scientific one. To me an obscurity is a reason for suspecting a fallacy."
