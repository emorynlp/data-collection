      "quote": "I'm a romantic; I would like Bigfoot to exist. I've met people who swear they've seen Bigfoot, and I think the interesting thing is, every single continent, there's an equivalent of Bigfoot or Sasquatch. There's the Yeti, the Yowie in Australia, the Chinese Wildman, and on and on and on."

      "quote": "As a child I had been obsessed by stories about Bigfoot. I grew up in the 1970s and early \u201880s, a time when Sasquatch had become a pop-culture icon after a string of movies and television shows exploited the public\u2019s apparent fascination with the creature. I became literate by reading some of the first books published on the subject. For years the creatures, which I had come to believe in wholeheartedly, even appeared to me in my dreams at night. They were otherworldly, existing far beyond the pale, yet fit perfectly into the fabric of my mental universe."

      "quote": "So far no Sasquatch, living or dead, or any of its mammoth body parts has been produced. Bigfoot enthusiasts say that because the creatures are nocturnal, numerically rare, and highly evasive, it is difficult to see one, let alone capture one. No Sasquatch remains are found, they add, because bodies of animals who die natural deaths in the forest are seldom ever found. Animals usually go into hiding when sick and vulnerable. Their remains, including bones, are picked apart by scavengers, and what\u2019s left quickly decomposes."

      "quote": "When asked why there isn\u2019t better photographic evidence than the handful of blurry, inconclusive pictures taken to date, Sasquatch enthusiasts say that it\u2019s hard to take quality pictures in high-contrast or dimly lit cluttered forests where Bigfoots, often seen at a distance, are usually exposed in the open for just a few seconds. Observers, they add, are so shaken by an encounter that most of them forget to use their cameras or phones."

      "quote": "One popular 1970s TV series, The Six Million Dollar Man, featured the most memorable fictional cameo involving the Sasquatch. In a two-part episode, the show\u2019s protagonist, a bell-bottomed cyborg secret agent named Steve Austin, fought a scraggly-looking, cave-dwelling Sasquatch (played by the seven-foot-four-inch-tall wrestler Andr\u00e9 the Giant). That bearded, white-eyed, feral beast, who turned out to be a robot created by space aliens, and whose image, I\u2019m certain, bore into the consciousness of millions of young people like me, derived its spellbinding horror from the fact that it looked and acted more like a human than an ape. It was cognizant, a 'wild man' in the truest sense of the term."

      "quote": "In the half century since big, upright creatures, leaving hundreds of tracks, were seen in the high snowfield on the north side of Mount Everest by a band of British mountaineers, the ye-teh, or yeti, has met with a storm of disapproval from upset scientists around the world. But as with the sasquatch of the vast rain forests of the Pacific Northwest, the case against the existence of the yeti \u2014 entirely speculative, and necessarily based on assumptions of foolishness or mendacity in many observers of good reputation \u2014 is even less 'scientific' than the evidence that it exists."

      "quote": "Stories about the beast are found elsewhere all around the globe. In the Himalayas, the Sherpa people of Nepal and Tibet have legends about a large, hairy beast that walks on two legs. They call the animal yeti, a term meaning 'rock-bear.' In Russia and Mongolia, the creature is known as Almas. In Scotland, tales are told about Am Fear Hath Mor, or 'Gray Man.' Chinese people tell of the Yeren, which means 'wild man.' In Australia, people call it a Yowie. To many who follow the oversize tracks of this legend, the mysterious creature is known simply as Bigfoot."

      "cite": "Pema Tsewang",
      "quote": "The Yeti, or Dremo in Tibetan, is a dim-witted mythical beast said to feed only on marmots. It sees a marmot, grabs the hapless creature, and then sits on it \u2014 saving the delicious morsel for later. And then the Yeti sees another marmot and leaps up to snatch it \u2014 while the first marmot makes a quick break for freedom. An image of bumbling, foolish effort \u2014 and the pitfalls of greed."

      "quote": "It has been theorized that Gigantopithecus karakus (Bigfoot) was not an antecedent of man, but a convergent species. This was an animal that was aware of man, possibly dealing with him on a regular basis. Following this concept, it can also be surmised as to why Bigfoot went into hiding. Did it compete with humans for food, water and habitat? It can be postulated that due to its size and/or relative appearance to man and his primeval behavior that the two species simply could not coexist. Primitive man was likely frightened by Bigfoot, and it is possible that he tried to scare it off, and at times hunt Bigfoot for food."

      "quote": "Unlike UFOs, Bigfoot sightings are not just limited to a certain segment of our population. Bigfoot sightings have been reported by all types of people, but after a thorough review of the data, I have determined that there are generally two types of people who are more apt to report a Bigfoot sighting. The data is inconclusive as to whether these two types of people have actually seen Bigfoot more often than other types; it just might be that they are more apt to report it. These two types of people are mushroom pickers, and cannabis enthusiasts. One popular theory for this is that Bigfoot might actually be attracted to tie-dyed clothing and the smell of burning cannabis, but this has never actually been proven."

      "quote": "Today\u2019s Sasquatch seekers have come to realize, through the DNA analysis of Sasquatch hair, droppings and nail clippings that what they used to call 'the creature,' the 'monster' and 'the missing link,' is in fact human. They are large hairy humans but can\u2019t we celebrate diversity and accept others whose physical appearance may be different than our own? You would never think of calling a logger a 'brush ape,' to their face anyway so why is it okay to call the Sasquatch People 'swamp monsters'? This startling new DNA evidence proves what the Native Americans have said all along. The Sasquatch are people. Still, Bigfoot Hunters want to prove the existence of the Sasquatch People so they can be protected but given our record of protecting other indigenous people, I\u2019d head for the hills before I got discovered if I was a Sasquatch."

      "quote": "Bigfoot is at least twice as big as a basking shark, lion, deer, bear, or Jessica Alba\u2019s bodyguards, has a much larger cranial capacity, and has opposable thumbs. People who want to save Bigfoot cite the beast is too human to kill. Are you kidding? That just makes it a killing machine."

      "quote": "When it comes to Bigfoot encounters, lumberjacks and drunken rednecks are your friend. Think about it. They\u2019re 1) big and hairy themselves, 2) fearless, 3) heavily armed, and 4) always ready for a fight. Watching this would be like sitting in the front row of bear wrestling at a rural bar."

      "quote": "Is Bigfoot a legitimate outdoor danger? There\u2019s no way to really know\u2014but yes. There is, however, a surefire way to avoid such a ferociously terrifying beast: Become an Indoorsman. Other than the 1987 family comedy Harry and the Hendersons, which starred John Lithgow, there is no record of a Sasquatch-type animal ever attempting to venture over a threshold and into an indoor space."

      "quote": "The bigfoot, as a species (Binomial Name: Homo Sasquatchis), does indeed exist. The Sasquatch is by nature, a very private animal. Guess what the 'natural enemy' of Bigfoot is? Humans, deforestation, you know . . . Manifest Destiny. What do you think that Bigfoot preys on? Cause they aren\u2019t herbivores. They don\u2019t eat honey. They eat: bears, coyotes, deer! And as humans spread farther and farther into Sasquatch territory and we send more unregulated 'Bigfoot Hunters' into the woods, well I think you can do the math: we scare bigfoot off and we have more bears, coyotes and deer to deal with."
