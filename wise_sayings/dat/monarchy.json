      "cite": "King James I",
      "quote": "The state of\u00c2\u00a0monarchy\u00c2\u00a0is the supremest thing upon earth: for kings are not only God's Lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon God's throne, but even by God himself they are called Gods."

      "quote": "How can a\u00c2\u00a0monarchy\u00c2\u00a0be a suitable thing, which allows a man to do as he pleases with none to hold him to account. And even if you were to take the best man on earth, and put him into a\u00c2\u00a0monarchy, you put outside him the thoughts that usually guide him."
