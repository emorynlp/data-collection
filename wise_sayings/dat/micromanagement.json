      "quote": "You can't micromanage. People who try to do that often fall on their faces. Incentivize those who work with you so you get the best work you can. Every career is a team effort, even if you're the one in front."

      "cite": "Simon Sinek",
      "quote": "A boss who micromanages is like a coach who wants to get in the game. Leaders guide and support and then sit back to cheer from the sidelines."

      "quote": "Trust is a core currency of any relationship. Sometimes our need to control and micromanage everything erodes our confidence in ourselves and others.

    {
      "cite": "Philip Kotler",
      "quote": "When managers overdo micromanaging of others, they probably hired the wrong people or failed to give them a clear idea of what each one is to accomplish. I prefer to train employees to be self-managers, just as in an orchestra each performer knows his or her role without being micromanaged."

    {
      "cite": "Diane Dreher",
      "quote": "Micromanaging erodes people's confidence, making them overly dependennt on their leaders. Well-meaning leaders inadvertently sabotage their teams by rushing to the rescue and offering too much help. A leader needs to balance assistance with wu wei, backing off long enough to let people learn from their mistakes and develop competence."

      "quote": "Sometimes what happens is that, when you micromanage actors and moments, it just doesn't quite live."

    {
      "cite": "Sarah Gadon",
      "quote": "In my experience, directors who are the most comfortable with themselves and confident in their work give you and everybody on the crew the freedom and the space to create. It's the people who are more insecure who feel the need to control and micromanage."

      "cite": "Karin Uhlich",
      "quote": "Micromanaging is ridiculous. There's always a certain amount of dynamic tension, which is good because it stimulates creative thinking. But what we want to look for (in city government) is a balance where each body or group of people is fulfilling their role."
