      "cite": "Adam Badeau",
      "quote": "I am a Vagabond: I care not who knows it, nor who is frightened from perusing my papers because of the announcement. You who dwell in dull propriety for ever, may be shocked; you who take names for things, may shut up the book; you may remember that Johnson defined a Vagabond as 'a term of reproach,' and that he stigmatized vagabundus as 'low Latin,' the lexicographer ! but you must at least admit that I who have so exact an appreciation of my own character, am likely to be correct in my notions about other people."

    {
      "cite": "Adam Badeau",
      "quote": "Vagabond has a merry sound in my ears; the word is at any rate classical French, and vagare was good enough Latin for Virgil; while as regards English, Shakespeare used it; and though Richard III does speak of 'vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,' all in one breath, surely the Crookback is poor authority in such matters; and though La Feu does say to Parolles, in 'All\u2019s Well that Ends Well,' 'You are a vagabond, and no true traveller,' La Feu was himself a scamp unworthy of belief. I maintain that the vagabonds are an illustrious fraternity."

      "cite": "Adam Badeau",
      "quote": "I am a vagabond around town. I go prying into all sorts of places, and frequent every corner of Manhattan. I purpose one day to give you a sketch of some scene \u2014 say in a pawnbroker\u2019s shop, and at another time will discuss the marvellous beauty of an opera singer\u2019s legs."

      "cite": "Todd DePastino",
      "quote": "Precisely why and how the term 'hobo' came into use remains a mystery. In the absence of any traceable etymology, contemporary observers turned to various origin myths, each more imaginative than the other. Some believed the Latin homo bonus ('good man') to be the root. Others privileged the familiar salutation 'Ho, boy!' or the descriptive 'hoc-boy.' Searching further afield, a creative few, such as William Aspinwall, argued that 'hobo' was an anglicized version of foreign phrases like 'Haut Beau.'"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Todd DePastino",
      "quote": "Willard used 'hobo' in a pejorative sense to denote the more aggressive western version of the work-shunning 'professional tramp.' Western workers themselves, however, came to adopt the term as a 'badge of honor' to distinguish themselves from other groups of homeless men, whom they derided with terms like 'tramp' and 'bum.'"

    {
      "cite": "Nels Anderson",
      "quote": "I have known men who had been hobo workers. Perhaps many can still be found. There was that minority who never could settle. For such there was only one course, to go down as they aged."

    {
      "cite": "S. Andrew Granade",
      "quote": "Most Americans of the time fell roughly into two camps in their attitudes toward the hobo. One side viewed the hobo as a rugged American individualist, flouting the law to live as he liked and reveling in the absolute freedom to control his destiny. This hobo lured many artist-intellectuals with the promise of experiencing America, including writers from Carl Sandburg to W.H. Davies, Vachel Lindsay, Harvey Kemp, Jack Kerouac, Robert Service, and Jim Tully. The other side viewed the hobo as a pitiful figure, victim of the rising industrial order."

      "cite": "Samuel Johnson",
      "quote": "Poor Sober! I have often teased him with reproof, and lie has often promised reformation: for no man is so much open to conviction as the idler, but there is none on whom it operates so little."

      "cite": "Samuel Johnson",

      "quote": "To you, clerk, literary man, sedentary person, man of fortune, idler . . . Up! The world (perhaps you now look upon it with pallid and disgusted eyes) is full of zest and beauty for you, if you approach it in the right spirit!"

      "cite": "Robert Southey",
      "quote": "Show me a man who cares no more for one place than another, and I will show you in that same person one who loves nothing but himself. Beware of those who are homeless by choice."

    {
      "cite": "Dietrich Bonhoeffer",
      "quote": "The hungry need bread and the homeless need a roof; the dispossessed need justice and the lonely need fellowship; the undisciplined need order and the slaves need freedom. To allow the hungry to remain hungry would be blasphemy against God and one\u2019s neighbor, for what is nearest to God is precisely the need of one\u2019s neighbor."

      "quote": "He festered in a Marseilles slum, / A starving genius, god-inspired. / You'd take him for a lousy bum, / Tho' poetry of paint he lyred, / In dreamy pastels each a gem: . . . / How people laughed at them!"
