      "cite": "Billy Connolly",
      "quote": "Once you become successful, people know where you live, the type of house you live in, the kind of car you drive, the clothes you wear, and so it would be patronising to go and talk like a welder. Welding's a mystery to me now. You can't go back, your life changes every day."

      "cite": "Ray Waddell",
      "quote": "It's what they do. If you're a welder and all of the sudden you're not the most popular welder on the block, are you going to quit welding? It's the same with any other occupation. Nobody should expect them to quit doing what they do."

      "cite": "Lorenzo Gaytan",
      "quote": "Nobody starts out knowing everything. You have to start at the bottom and pick people's brains. When I got out of the service, I became a sheet-metal worker. I was an apprentice for five years. I found out who the top people were in my trade, and I asked to work with them. I asked them a lot of questions. How can we do this a little faster, a little cheaper, a little better? Once they know where you're coming from, they open up."

      "cite": "Norman Vincent Peale",
      "quote": "A workman at my farm showed me a broken metal bar. He fitted the two ends together, then subjected the joint to intense heat in the process of welding so that, as he explained, \"the molecules flowed together in fusion.\" He told me that if he were to use a sledgehammer to hit the welded bar with force, it might break, but most likely not at the point where it had been welded. He was telling me that the metal bar could become strongest at its hitherto weakest place."

    {
      "cite": "Marty Rice",
      "quote": "If you plan on becoming a TIG welder, you better plan on doing lots and lots of burning."

    {
      "cite": "Herman Munster",
      "quote": "That lady welder and I are just friends. Just because I'm a welder, you know, doesn't mean I'm carrying a torch for her."

      "cite": "Frank 'Frankie' Hauser",
      "quote": "Boy, if my folks would only let me work. Then I could do all the things I want to do. I could take you dancing, the way you like to go, places you like to go to. You know, they need welders. They need 'em worse than soldiers."
