      "cite": "Clarence Day",
      "quote": "Ants are good citizens; they place group interest first. But they carry it so far, they have few or no political rights. An\u00a0ant doesn't have the vote, apparently; he just has his duties."

      "cite": "Fyodor Dostoevsky",
      "quote": "Every ant \u00a0knows the \u00a0formula of its ant-hill, every \u00a0bee knows \u00a0the formula \u00a0of its \u00a0beehive. They know it \u00a0in their own way, not in our way. Only humankind does not know its own formula."

    {
      "cite": "Bernard Werber",
      "quote": "Ants can live together in solidarity and forget themselves in the community. In a normative capitalist society, everyone is an egoist. In the ants' civilization, you are part of the group; you don't live for yourself alone."

    {
      "cite": "Bill Mason",
      "quote": "What is it about the ant way of life that has stood the test of time so well? All ants belong to extended families, and carry their prey home to share. Unselfishness is the rule. Everything they do is for their colony's good."

      "quote": "The idiotic industry of an\u00a0ant\u00a0building his hill in the path of a glacier, and imagining that he is free."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Lewis Thomas",
      "quote": "Ants are more like the parts of an animal than entities on their own. They are mobile cells, circulating through a dense connective tissue of other ants in a matrix of twigs. The circuits are so intimately interwoven that the anthill meets all the essential criteria of an organism."

    {
      "cite": "H. L. Mencken",

      "cite": "Honoree Corder",
      "quote": "Ants\u00a0are a terrific analogy for the route to success. They will go over, under, around, or through whatever gets in their way. They never stop moving, and neither should you. Take the word impossible and turn it into I'm Possible."
    },
    {
      "cite": "William Morton Wheeler",
      "quote": "Ants are not only efficient, they are hard-working and thrifty, qualities which have always seemed like good reasons for seeing them as virtuous role models."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Ralph Waldo Emerson",
      "quote": "The instincts of the ant are very unimportant, considered as the ants; but the moment a ray of relation is seen to be a monitor, a little body with a mighty heart, then all its habits, even that said to be recently observed, that it never sleeps, become sublime."

      "cite": "PROVERBS",
      "quote": "Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise."
    },
    {
      "cite": "James Surowiecki",
      "quote": "If army\u00a0ants are wandering around and they get lost, they start to follow a simple rule:Just do what the\u00a0ant\u00a0in front of you does. The\u00a0ants eventually end up in a circle. There's this famous example of one that was 1,200 feet long and lasted for two days; the\u00a0ants just kept marching around and around in a circle until they died."

    {
      "cite": "Richard Jefferies",
      "quote": "It would seem that the\u00a0ant\u00a0works its way tentatively, and, observing where it fails, tries another place and succeeds."
