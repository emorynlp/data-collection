      "cite": "Baltasar Gracian",
      "quote": "Never exaggerate. It is a matter of great importance to forego superlatives, in part to avoid offending the truth, and in part to avoid cheapening your judgment. Exaggeration wastes distinction and testifies to the paucity of your understanding and taste."

      "cite": "Alice Meynell",
      "quote": "But exaggeration establishes no good understanding between the reader and the author. It is a solemn appeal to our credulity, and we are right to resent it. It is the violence of a weakling hand\u2014the worst manner of violence."

      "cite": "Ralph Waldo Emerson",
      "quote": "Exaggeration is in the course of things. Nature sends no creature, no man into the world, without adding a small excess of his proper quality. Given the planet, it is still necessary to add the impulse; so, to every creature nature added a little violence of direction in its proper path, a shove to put it on its way; in every instance, a slight generosity, a drop too much."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Henry David Thoreau",
      "quote": "Exaggeration! was ever any virtue attributed to a man without exaggeration? was ever any vice, without infinite exaggeration? Do we not exaggerate ourselves to ourselves, or do we recognize ourselves for the actual men we are? Are we not all great men? Yet what are we actually, to speak of? We live by exaggeration."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Daniel Starch",
      "quote": "Examples of exaggeration can be found in almost any advertising medium. The use of the superlative is altogether too prevalent. 'The finest,' 'the best,' 'the greatest,' 'the purest,' 'the most economical,' and so on ad infinitum, are hurled at the public everywhere. Surely not all products of the same class can be the best or the finest."

    {
      "cite": "Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset",
      "quote": "By speaking, by thinking, we undertake to clarify things, and that forces us to exacerbate them, dislocate them, schematize them. Every concept is in itself an exaggeration."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Eliza Cook",
      "quote": "Exaggeration misleads the credulous and offends the perceptive."
    },
    {

From laughter and tears the descent is easy to sniveling and giggles."
