    {
      "cite": "Henry Ward Beecher",
      "quote": "Our days are a kaleidoscope. Every instant a change takes place in the contents. New harmonies, new contrasts, new combinations of every sort. Nothing ever happens twice alike. The most familiar people stand each moment in some new relation to each other, to their work, to surrounding objects. The most tranquil house, with the most serene inhabitants, living upon the utmost regularity of system, is yet exemplifying infinite diversities."

    {
      "cite": "Henry Ward Beecher",
      "quote": "One might as well attempt to calculate mathematically the contingent forms of the tinkling bits of glass in a kaleidoscope as to look through the tube of the future and foretell its pattern."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Judith Lennox",
      "quote": "Often she felt as though she had been picked up and turned about like a kaleidoscope, that all her complacent assumptions had been shaken up and reassembled in a different order."

      "cite": "Sara Bareilles",
      "quote": "The idea behind a kaleidoscope is that it is a structure that's filled with broken bits and pieces, and somehow if you can look through them, you still see something beautiful. And I feel like we are all that way a little bit."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Mark Twain",
      "quote": "There is no such thing as a new idea. It is impossible. We simply take a lot of old ideas and put them into a sort of mental kaleidoscope. We give them a turn and they make new and curious combinations. We keep on turning and making new combinations indefinitely; but they are the same old pieces of colored glass that have been in use through all the ages."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Elton John",
      "quote": "There's a time for everyone, If they only learn, that the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn."

    {
      "cite": "Bill Crawford",
      "quote": "Our past is not, as some fear, a series of events carved in stone that we must carry around for the rest of our lives... but a kaleidoscope of experiences that, when viewed through different lenses, can 'color' (change) how we see our present and future."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Dorothy Height",
      "quote": "I think of my life as a unity of circles. Some are concentric, others overlap, but they all connect in some way. Sometimes the connections don't happen for years. But when they do, I marvel. As in a shimmering kaleidoscope, familiar patterns keep unfolding."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Michael Ondaatje",
      "quote": "For we live with those retrievals from childhood that coalesce and echo throughout our lives, the way shattered pieces of glass in a kaleidoscope reappear in new forms and are songlike in their refrains and rhymes, making up a single monologue. We live permanently in the recurrence of our own stories, whatever story we tell."
    },
    {
      "cite": "A.J. Darkholme",
      "quote": "We\u2019re all blurry-eyed wanderers of time, and the unfortunance of it all is that we\u2019d probably all go on to do great things if only we searched for what corrected and focused our vision instead of relying on our past \u2013 life\u2019s grand kaleidoscope \u2013 to help us find our way forward."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Marcel Proust",
      "quote": "Like a kaleidoscope which is every now and then given a turn, society arranges successively in different orders elements which one would have supposed immutable, and composes a new pattern."
    },
    {
      "cite": "James Edward Allen",
      "quote": "The world is your kaliedoscope, and the varying combinations of colors which at every succeeding moment it presents to you are the exquisitely adjusted pictures of your ever moving thoughts."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Napoleon Hill",
      "quote": "Life, on this Earth may be likened to a great Kaleidoscope before which the scenes and facts and material substances are ever shifting and changing and all any man can do is to take these facts and substances and re-arrange them in new combinations."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Frederick Lenz",
      "quote": "You're looking through the kaleidoscope of God and seeing God's face in so many ways, as friends, as strangers, passersby, country roads, jammed freeways, the cancer ward, the maternity ward - all the faces of God surround you at all times."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Arthur Helps",
      "quote": "Many a man has a kind of a kaleidoscope, where the bits of broken glass are his own merits and fortunes; and they fall into harmonious arrangements, and delight him, often most mischievously and to his ultimate detriment; but they are a present pleasure."
    },
    {
      "cite": "unknown",
      "quote": "The kaleidoscope of colour which is my life, shows the interesting choices I've made along the way."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Agatha Christie",
      "quote": "Curious, sometimes, how one's thoughts seemed to swing in a kaleidoscope. It happened to me now. A bewildering shuffling and reshuffling of memories, of events. Then the mosaic settled into its true pattern."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Holly Schindler",
      "quote": "As we stand there, it hits me how quickly everything changes - how life is like peering into a kaleidoscope, and just as you're looking at a gorgeous pattern you think you'd maybe even like to keep around forever, the colors morph into something completely different, and there's no getting back to that first pattern. No matter how much you'd like to see it again."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Lang Leav",
      "quote": "I have always thought of memories as fragments, like colored glass shards in a kaleidoscope. It is the source of great beauty in our lives, yet the cause of such heartache."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Carolyn Haines",
      "quote": "Forest Gump had it wrong. Life is not a box of chocolate; it's a kaleidoscope. In the flip of a wrist, realities are shredded and the world takes on a totally new shape."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Betsy Byars",
      "quote": "It was as if her life was a huge kaleidoscope, and the kaleidoscope had been turned and now everything was changed. The same stones shaken, no longer made the same design."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Jeanette LeBlanc",
      "quote": "Life cracks us into unrecognizable shards of former incarnations. Slivers of our hurt and our pain and our shame nestles next to fragments of our truth, our divinity, our fierce reclamation of power. It is this very brokenness that allows us to knit together, kaleidoscope style. And we spin and shift and turn to the light until we appear brilliant, lit from within. Suddenly we are revealed; unexpected beauty born directly from brokenness. We have to be willing to break in order to become."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Srijata",
      "quote": "Kaleidoscope.Tiny bits of brightness, Floating and making patterns, And when you want these to make sense, They laugh and create pretty imperfections, You try and read into these and make your own perfect stories...Aren't we all the storytellers creating vivid poetry out of those tiny bits of brightness..."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Jean Houston",
      "quote": "At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities."

    {
      "cite": "Pascal Mercier",
      "quote": "We are stratified creatures, creatures full of abysses, with a soul of inconstant quicksilver, with a mind whose color and shape change as in a kaleidoscope that is constantly shaken."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Alan Lightman",
      "quote": "But what is the past? Could it be, the firmness of the past is just illusion? Could the past be a kaleidoscope, a pattern of images that shift with each disturbance of a sudden breeze, a laugh, a thought? And if the shift is everywhere, how would we know?"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Rosabeth Moss Kanter",
      "quote": "Creativity is a lot like looking at the world through a kaleidoscope. You look at a set of elements, the same ones everyone else sees, but then reassemble those floating bits and pieces into an enticing new possibility."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Charles Bartlett Johnson",
      "quote": "Black life is ambiguous, and a kaleidoscope of meanings, rich, multi-sided . . . we have frozen our vision in figures that caricature, at best the complexity of our lives and leave the real artistic chore of interpretation unfinished."
