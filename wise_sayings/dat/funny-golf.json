And maybe that's why the highs were so high and the lows felt so low. Could you in the moment quiet your thoughts and execute? It was glorious when you did!"

    {
      "cite": "Lorii Myers",
      "quote": "When we watch pro golfers, we expect them to play well, to make the shots we know we can\u2019t, and to be entertaining. Their expectation, however, is very different. They expect to succeed!"

    {
      "cite": "Joe Posnanski",
      "quote": "Perhaps more than any other sport, golf focuses pressure on the player. There are no time constraints, as there are in other sports. Your competitors are not allowed to hinder you, as they are in other sports. The pressure originates in yourself; it builds from doubts. A two-foot putt on the practice green doesn\u2019t spark many doubts. A two-foot putt to win a bet or a tournament or a Masters is another thing entirely."

      "quote": "And there's many neat cottages with gardens very nice / And picturesque villas, which can be rented at a reasonable price / Besides, there's a golf course for those that such a game seeks / Which would prove a great attraction to the knights of clubs and cleeks."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Kurt Philip Behm",
      "quote": "Like clubs inside my golf bag / each verse a different face / Some to drive straight down the course / others lift and then embrace."
    },
