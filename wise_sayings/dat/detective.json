Waiting for advice. / Kneejerk reactions are invoked today more so than usual."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Patricia Cornwell",
      "quote": "The Ripper case is not one to be conclusively solved by DNA or fingerprints, and in a way, this is good. Society has come to expect the wizardry of forensic science to solve all crimes, but without the human element of deductive skills, teamwork, very hard investigation, and smart prosecution, evidence means nothing."
