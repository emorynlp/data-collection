      "cite": "John Wayne",
      "quote": "The difference between acting and reacting is that in a bad picture, you see them acting all over the place. In a good picture, they react in a logical way to a situation they're in, so the audience can identify with the actors."

      "quote": "Acting... is the ability to react to imaginary stimuli; and its essential elements remain the twin requisites... 'unusual sensitivity and extraordinary intelligence,' this latter not in the form of book learning but in the ability to comprehend the workings of the human soul. The essential problems in acting\u2014does the actor 'feel' or does he merely imitate? Should he speak naturally or rhetorically? What is natural? etc.\u2014are as old as acting itself. They derive not from the realistic movement but from the nature of the acting process."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Sir John Gielgud",
      "quote": "Of all the arts, I think acting must be the least concrete, the most solitary.

These people are essential to the development of one's performance\u2014they are the living canvas upon which one hopes to paint the finished portrait which one has envisaged."

      "cite": "Meryl Streep",
      "quote": "Acting is simply my way of investigating human nature and having fun at the same time."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Olivia de Havilland",
      "quote": "Thrust into my profession without any training whatsoever, I had to just flounder and just find my way. It was an agonizing experience. It's like jumping off a diving board in the Olympic contest without knowing how to swim or dive, and I just had to find my way. So one day, I said to Jimmy Cagney, 'Jimmy, what is acting?' and he said, 'I don't know.' He said, 'All I can tell you is whatever you say, mean it,' and I thought that marvelous counsel. It is key. Wonderful."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Sir Derek Jacobi",

    {
      "cite": "John Cusack",
      "quote": "Like all actors, I really just reveal my shadow every time I work. And the shadow is all the pain, shame, anger and rage, the creativity and sexuality."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Sam Rockwell",
      "quote": "Acting is so pure. It's not necessarily all the mundane moments that we have in real life. It's like condensed drama. It's all the exciting moments in two hours. Your senses have to be heightened."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Michael J. Fox",
      "quote": "Actors are people who were good at playing 'Let's Pretend' as kids and now we're getting money to play house."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Terrence Howard",
      "quote": "They say that all great actors are crazy. Life has driven them mad, but that madness gives them a well of opportunity to draw experiences from 'til they can relate to what seems obscure and far away and out of reach."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Charlton Heston",

    {
      "cite": "Katharine Hepburn",
      "quote": "Acting is the most minor of gifts and not a very high-class way to earn a living. Shirley Temple could do it at the age of four."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Oscar Wilde",
      "quote": "The mere mechanical technique of acting can be taught, but the spirit that is to give life to lifeless forms must be born in a man. No dramatic college can teach its pupils to think or to feel."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Bette Davis",
      "quote": "Without wonder and insight, acting is just a trade. With it, it becomes  creation."
