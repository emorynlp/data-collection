      "quote": "Remember, you don't compete with anyone, you make them compete with you. You can control what you put on yourself; you can't control what the other guy puts on you. So you focus only on the internal pressure that drives you. Run to it, embrace it, feel it, so no one else can throw more at you than you've already put on yourself."

    {
      "cite": "Lilly Singh",
      "quote": "Competition gives birth to a lot of success, and if no one ever challenged you, you wouldn't go anywhere. It makes sense to compete with others for a promotion at work. But so many women take it a step further and won't even support other women. They end up competing over things that don't make sense - like how we look."

One we must be sensitive to, especially when evaluating our own motivations and behavior."

    },
    {
      "cite": "C. Smith Sumner",
      "quote": "Life is not a competition with others. In its truest sense it is rivalry with ourselves. We should each day seek to break the record of our yesterday. We should seek each day to live stronger, better, truer lives; each day to master some weakness of yesterday; each day to repair past follies; each day to surpass ourselves. This is, simply, progress."
