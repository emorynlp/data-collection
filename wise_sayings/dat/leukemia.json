      "quote": "My experience of cancer has made me a much stronger person. People say that I must look at life differently now. Not at all!

      "cite": "Lindsey Haun",
      "quote": "I think everybody has their pain. For me, the time that I really had to grow up was when I was 15 and I had my best friend die of leukemia. Watching somebody so strong go through that is definitely something that will give you a little bit of depth. There have been a lot of things that have happened in my life that has forced me to grow up."

      "cite": "Chila Woychik",
      "quote": "The unrelenting grip of Soldier's Syndrome slips finger by slow finger. The marrow's been affected-emotional leukemia at the deepest level. Transplants of love and friendship aid healing, yet time is still key, and the clock never ticks fast enough. Eternity gains perspective when seconds feel like years. How long have I been gone? Six eternities and counting."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Siddhartha Mukherjee",
      "quote": "But the story of leukemia the story of cancer isn't the story of doctors who struggle and survive, moving from institution to another. It is the story of patients who struggle and survive, moving from on embankment of illness to another. Resilience, inventiveness, and survivorship qualities often ascribed to great physicians are reflected qualities, emanating first from those who struggle with illness and only then mirrored by those who treat them. If the history of medicine is told through the stories of doctors, it is because their contributions stand in place of the more substantive heroism of their patients."

      "cite": "Cory Hardrict",
      "quote": "My mum died of leukemia when I was in high school - she lost her life at 40. It was very hard, and I didn't do that much in Chicago after that. I actually sat around and didn't do anything for three years. I didn't know what I wanted to do anymore because my everything was gone. I was a mama's boy, and I had to turn into a man real quick."

He had to know all that she had ever loved was he. That was their last rain together. And, that was a day before the doctor declared, she was in the last stage of Leukemia."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Isaac Asimov",
      "quote": "The fact that the general incidence of leukemia has doubled in the last two decades may be due, partly, to the increasing use of x-rays for numerous purposes. The incidence of leukemia in doctors, who are likely to be so exposed, is twice that of the general public. In radiologists \u2026 the incidence is ten times greater."
