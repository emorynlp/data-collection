      "cite": "Robert T. Bakker",
      "quote": "It's very simple why kids are crazy about dinosaurs -- dinosaurs are nature's Special Effects. They are the only real dragons. Kids love dragons. It's not just being weirdly shaped and being able to eat Buicks. It's that they are real."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Robert T. Bakker",
      "quote": "The public image of dinosaurs is tainted by extinction. It's hard to accept dinosaurs as a success when they are all dead. But the fact of ultimate extinction should not make us overlook the absolutely unsurpassed role dinosaurs played in the history of life."

      "quote": "If we measured success by longevity, then\u00a0dinosaurs must rank as the number one success story in the history of land life."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Robert T. Bakker",
      "quote": "Dinosaurs are the jumper cables to the human mind. Kids can't curb their enthusiasm when they're in a hall of\u00a0dinosaurs and mammoths and mammoth hunters and trilobites and giant fish that could chomp up a shark. These natural objects in motion and context make kids want to read; you can't stop them from reading and thinking."

    {
      "cite": "Arthur C. Clarke",
      "quote": "The dinosaurs disappeared because they could not adapt to their changing environment. We shall disappear if we cannot adapt to an environment that now contains spaceships, computers \u2014 and thermonuclear weapons."

    {
      "cite": "Steve Miller",
      "quote": "Dinosaurs may be extinct from the face of the planet, but they are alive and well in our imaginations."

    {
      "cite": "Robert T. Bakker",
      "quote": "Dinosaurs have a bad public image as symbols of obsolescence and hulking inefficiency; in political cartoons they are know-nothing conservatives that plod through miasmic swamps to inevitable extinction."

    {
      "cite": "Kanye West",
      "quote": "The\u00a0dinosaurs are remembered only by their bones. What will we be remembered for with humanity?"
