      "cite": "Susan Blackmore",
      "quote": "One of the biggest mistakes that people make when they think about memes is they try to extend on the analogy with genes. That's not how it works. It works by realizing the concept of a replicator."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Richard Dawkins",
      "quote": "The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry."
    },
    {
      "cite": "John Hodgman",
      "quote": "Any time you try to create an Internet meme, automatic fail. That's like the worst thing you can do.\u00c2"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Daniel C. Dennett",
      "quote": "The haven all memes depend on reaching is the human mind, but a human mind is itself an artifact created when memes restructure a human brain in order to make it a better habitat for memes."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Peter Watts",
      "quote": "Not even the most heavily-armed police state can exert brute force to all of its citizens all of the time. Meme management is so much subtler; the rose-tinted refraction of perceived reality, the contagious fear of threatening alternatives."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Richard Dawkins",
      "quote": "The interesting question would be whether there's a Darwinian process, a kind of selection process whereby some memes are more likely to spread than others, because people like them, because they're popular, because they're catchy or whatever it might be."
    },
    {
      "cite": "M.I.A",
      "quote": "Creativity needs time to harness before it goes out, and because that's difficult, memes have become the creative language."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Christopher Poole",
      "quote": "When we think of memetic culture, it is the sausage factory of the old days.\u00c2"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Jay Roach",
      "quote": "You can make an idea spread for good but you can also make an idea spread for bad and the power to make an idea spread, memetics, you know which now people talk about memes."

    {
      "cite": "Jake Paul",
      "quote": "People naturally want to retweet and engage on super funny videos and memes.\u00c2"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Kalle Lasn",
      "quote": "A meme (rhymes with dream) is a unit of information (a catchphrase, a concept, a tune, a notion of fashion, philosophy or politics) that leaps from brain to brain. Memes compete with one another for replication, and are passed down through a population much the same way genes pass through a species."
    },
    {
      "cite": "James Gleick",
      "quote": "As for memes, the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmeme' is a cliche, which is to say it's already a meme. We all hear it all the time, and maybe we even have started to use it in ordinary speech. The man who invented it was Richard Dawkins, who was, not coincidentally, an evolutionary biologist. And he invented it as an analog for the gene."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza",
      "quote": "Specific units - such as memes are intended to represent have meaning when there is essential discontinuity between categories. Such convenient discontinuities are found in atoms, elementary particles, genes, and DNA."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Susan Blackmore",
      "quote": "Certainly almost everything we do and think is colored in some way by memes, but it is important to realize that not everything we experience is a meme. If I walk down the street and see a tree, the basic perception that's going on is not memetic"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Daniel C. Dennett",
      "quote": "Words are memes that can be pronounced."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Daniel C. Dennett",
      "quote": "Minds are in limited supply, and each mind has a limited capacity for memes, and hence there is considerable competition among memes for entry in as many minds as possible."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Ernst Mayr",
      "quote": "In neither his definition nor the examples illustrating what memes are does Dawkins mention anything that would distinguish memes from concepts."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Richard Dawkins",
      "quote": "An Internet meme is a hijacking of the original idea. Instead of mutating by random change and spreading by a form of Darwinian selection, Internet memes are altered deliberately by human creativity. There is no attempt at accuracy of copying, as with genes - and as with memes in their original version"
