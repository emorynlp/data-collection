      "cite": "Marianne Williamson",
      "quote": "Take stock of your thoughts and behavior. Each night ask yourself, when were you negative when you could have been positive? When did you withhold love when you might have given it? When did you play a neurotic game instead of behaving in a powerful way? Use this process to self-correct."

      "cite": "Herbert A. Simon",
      "quote": "Human beings, viewed as behaving systems, are quite simple. The apparent complexity of our behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which we find ourselves."

      "cite": "Michael Josephson",
      "quote": "The way we treat people we think can\u2019t help or hurt us\u2014like housekeepers, waiters, and secretaries\u2014tells more about our character than how we treat people we think are important. How we behave when we think no one is looking or when we don\u2019t think we will get caught more accurately portrays our character than what we say or do in service of our reputations."

    {
      "cite": "Epictetus",
      "quote": "Remember that you ought to behave in life as you would at a banquet. As something is being passed around it comes to you; stretch out your hand, take a portion of it politely. It passes on; do not detain it. Or it has not come to you yet; do not project your desire to meet it, but wait until it comes in front of you. So act toward children, so toward a wife, so toward office, so toward wealth."

      "cite": "Warren Buffett",
      "quote": "The big question about how people behave is whether they've got an Inner Scorecard or an Outer Scorecard. It helps if you can be satisfied with an Inner Scorecard."

    {
      "cite": "P.J. O'Rourke",
      "quote": "The weirder you're going to behave, the more normal you should look. It works in reverse, too. When I see a kid with three or four rings in his nose, I know there is absolutely nothing extraordinary about that person."

      "quote": "Behave so the aroma of your actions may enhance the general sweetness of the atmosphere."

    {
      "cite": "Michael Josephson",
      "quote": "What a person says and does in ordinary moments when no one is looking reveals more about true character than grand actions taken while in the spotlight. Our true character is revealed by normal, consistent, everyday attitudes and behavior, not by self-conscious words or deeds or rare acts of moral courage."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Francis Bacon",
      "quote": "Behavior seemeth to me as a garment of the mind, and to have the conditions of a garment. For it ought to be made in fashion; it ought not to be too curious; it ought to be shaped so as to set forth any good making of the mind, and hide any deformity; and above all, it ought not to be too straight, or restrained for exercise or motion."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart",
      "quote": "Just as people behave to me, so do I behave to them. When I see that a person despises me and treats me with contempt, I can be as proud as any peacock."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Ralph Barton Perry",
      "quote": "A man's behavior on dry land differs from his behavior in water; he acts differently indoors and out, in summer and in winter. A man's behavior is always a function of his environment; that is one of the things we mean by behavior."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Leo Buscaglia",
      "quote": "I believe that you control your destiny, that you can be what you want to be. You can also stop and say, 'No, I won't do it, I won't behave this way anymore. I'm lonely and I need people around me, maybe I have to change my methods of behaving,' and then you do it."

      "cite": "Joyce Meyer",
      "quote": "Patience is not simply the ability to wait\u2014it's how we behave while we're waiting."

    {
      "cite": "Tom Lickona; Eric Schaps; Catherine Lewis",
      "quote": "One\u2019s character is one\u2019s habitual way of behaving. We all have patterns of behavior or habits, and often we are quite unaware of them. When Socrates urged us to Know thyself, he clearly was directing us to come to know our habitual ways of responding to the world around us."

      "cite": "Mario Bunge; Ruben Ardila",

    },
    {
      "cite": "Henry Miller",
      "quote": "Most of the ills we suffer from are directly traceable to our own behavior. Man is not suffering from the ravages wrought by earthquakes and volcanoes, by tornadoes and tidal waves; he is suffering from his own misdeeds, his own foolishness, his own ignorance and disregard of natural laws."

      "cite": "Abraham J. Heschel",
      "quote": "A test of a people is how it behaves toward the old. It is easy to love children. Even tyrants and dictators make a point of being fond of children. But the affection and care for the old, the incurable, the helpless are the true gold mines of a culture."

      "cite": "Charlie Brooker",
      "quote": "There are different groups of people in your life that you behave slightly differently with. You behave one way with your family. You behave in a different way with your work colleagues. You behave differently with your friends from the movie club, your fitness instructor\u2060\u2014all subtly different personas."

      "cite": "Noah Baumbach",
      "quote": "I think sometimes bad behaviour can be liberating for certain people. They need to behave badly to find themselves\u2014to go off path to find their path. You see it with kids all the time: They're testing boundaries, and I think that's healthy."

      "quote": "When a person tries to act in accordance with his conscience, when he tries to speak the truth, when he tries to behave like a citizen, even in conditions where citizenship is degraded, it won't necessarily lead anywhere, but it might. There's one thing, however, that will never lead anywhere, and that is speculating that such behavior will lead somewhere."

      "cite": "Melanie Joy",
      "quote": "Our values and behaviors are incongruent, and this incongruence causes us a certain degree of moral discomfort.
