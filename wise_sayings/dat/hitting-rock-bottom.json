Some have run away from their own thoughts. Some have coiled themselves up into a stoical indifference. Some have braved the trouble, and defied it. Some have carried it as a tree does a wound, until by new wood it can overgrow and cover the old rash."

But after a while, even though the dips and swells continue to appear, there seems to seep into the life of the griever a confidence, hard-won, that underlies all the swirls and tides of life's ongoing struggles and joys. A sense that we have hit rock bottom and come slowly back, and that, though we will have further trials and doubts (and we will!), there is a level of stability and confidence which, even in dark hours, we will know is there and will not let us drop through the bottom of the sea."

      "quote": "Strong feelings, even suffering, are part of the process of finding and liberating our true selves. The awakening of our spirits includes moments of intensity and turmoil, darkness and loss. For us to be willing to undergo such fundamental change as redefining our sexuality or facing a problem of addiction, we may first have had to 'hit bottom.'"

      "cite": "Elizabeth Wurtzel",
      "quote": "And I know, knew for sure, with an absolute certainty, that this is rock bottom, this what the worst possible thing feels like. It is not some grand, wretched emotional breakdown. It is, in fact, so very mundane:\u2026Rock Bottom is an inability to cope with the commonplace that is so extreme it makes even the grandest and loveliest things unbearable\u2026Rock bottom is feeling that the only thing that matters in all of life is the one bad moment\u2026Rock bottom is everything out of focus. It\u2019s a failure of vision, a failure to see the world how it is, to see the good in what it is, and only to wonder why the hell things look the way they do and not\u2014and not some other way."

    {
      "cite": "\u00c9mile Durkheim",
