      "cite": "Lois P Frankel",
      "quote": "So why do women stay in the place of girlhood long after it\u2019s productive for them? One reason is because we\u2019ve been taught that acting like a nice girl\u2014even when we\u2019re grown up\u2014isn\u2019t such a bad thing. Girls get taken care of in ways that boys don\u2019t. Girls aren\u2019t expected to fend for or take care of themselves\u2014others do that for them....People like girls. Men want to protect you. Cuddly or sweet, tall or tan, girls don\u2019t ask for much. They\u2019re nice to be around and they\u2019re nice to have around\u2014sort of like pets."

      "cite": "Tyra Banks",
      "quote": "I wish I was harder; I wish I didn't care so much about being the nice girl all the time because a lot of the time people can take kindness for weakness, so I wish I had a little bit more 'oomph' in me."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Fran Hauser",
      "quote": "Over time, I was surprised to find that owning my niceness actually made it easier for me to speak up, push back, and voice my opinions at work because I wasn\u2019t so consumed by trying to be something I was not. Instead, my confidence soared along with my effectiveness because I was finally free to be my authentically nice and caring self."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Beverly Engel",
      "quote": "It is my contention that Nice Girl behavior sets women up to be misused and abused. This does not mean that women cause men to become abusive. It does not mean that women are masochists. What it does mean is that by being too nice, women send a strong message to those who already have a tendency to use and abuse. The message is: \u201cMy need to be seen as nice (or sweet or innocent) is more powerful than my instinct to protect myself.\u201d"

You were the 'bad girl' or the 'good girl' or the 'bad mother' or 'the good mother,' 'the horrible businesswoman who eschewed her children' or 'the earth mother who was happy to be at home baking pies,' all of that stuff that we sort of knew was a lie."

    {
      "cite": "Phoebe Waller-Bridge",
      "quote": "As women, we get the message about how to be a good girl - how to be a good, pretty girl - from such an early age. Then, at the same time, we're told that well-behaved girls won't change the world or ever make a splash."

    {
      "cite": "Rachel Simmons",
      "quote": "Many girls aspire to a version of selfhood that puts a psychological glass ceiling on their potential to succeed. They suffer from what I call the Curse of the Good Girl: the pressure to be liked by everyone, generous to a fault, and flawless at everything you do."

      "quote": "Good girl doesn\u2019t exist; you just have to choose between bad and worse."

      "cite": "Amy Poehler",
      "quote": "I love saying 'yes' and I love saying 'please.' Saying 'yes' doesn't mean I don't know how to say no, and saying 'please' doesn't mean I am waiting for permission. 'Yes please' sounds powerful and concise. It's a response and a request. It is not about being a good girl; it is about being a real woman."
