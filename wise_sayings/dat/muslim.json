We don't need to become just like men to be honored, and we don't need to wait for a prince to save or complete us. Our worth, our honor, our salvation, and our completion lie not in the slave. But, in the Lord of the slave."

    {
      "cite": "Ibrahim Hooper",
      "quote": "There are Muslim women wearing hijab in our nation's military. Whether it's hijab or beards or turbans, to cling to these outdated \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctraditions' merely out of a sense of not wanting to change anything is, I think, untenable in this day and age and in our increasingly diverse society."
