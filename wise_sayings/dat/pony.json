Robbo!\" as our hero cantered by, / The people in the Leger Stand cried out, \"Hi, mister, hi! / Are you on it?\" / They watched him as the flag went down; his fate is quickly told -- / The pony gave a sudden spring, and off the rider rolled. / The pony finished first all right, but then our hero bold / Was not on it."
