      "quote": "There are moths outside, ready to die for a light they crave but which is denied to them, shielded from them. Sometimes, in the midst of all I have been given, I watch the moths in us all. Everybody has a light which they think they cannot live without."

      "quote": "The Moth don't care when he sees The Flame. He might get burned, but he's in the game. And once he's in, he can't go back, he'll Beat his wings 'til he burns them black... No, The Moth don't care when he sees The Flame. . . The Moth don't care if The Flame is real, 'Cause Flame and Moth got a sweetheart deal. And nothing fuels a good flirtation, Like Need and Anger and Desperation... No, The Moth don't care if The Flame is real..."

      "cite": "Kayla Krantz",
      "quote": "I\u2019ve always preferred moths to butterflies. They aren\u2019t flashy or cocky; they mind their own business and just try to blend in with their surroundings and live their lives. They don\u2019t want to be seen, and that\u2019s something I can relate to."
