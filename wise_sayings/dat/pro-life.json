      "quote": "I'm pro-life. The law protects women's right to chose, and I think there's a competing right, which is the rights of the unborn. And as you get closer to term, I think the rights of the unborn become more and more prevalent."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Stanley Fish",
      "quote": "I should have known better. Pro-life arguments are now based on scientific evidence and the pro-choice arguments are not. That is a cultural, historical fact."

      "cite": "Alveda King",

    },
    {
      "cite": "George W. Bush",
      "quote": "I believe that life is valuable, even when it is unwanted, even when it is physically imperfect. I believe our society has a responsibility to defend the vulnerable and the weak.

    {
      "cite": "Frederica Mathewes-Green",
      "quote": "Like an animal caught in a trap, trying to gnaw off its own leg, a woman who seeks abortion is trying to escape a desperate situation by an act of violence and self-loss. Abortion is not a sign that women are free, but a sign that they are desperate."

      "cite": "Pope Benedict XVI",
      "quote": "The fundamental human right, the presupposition of every other right, is the right to life itself. This is true of life from the moment of conception until its natural end. Abortion, consequently, cannot be a human right \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it is the very opposite. It is a deep wound in society."
    },

      "cite": "Rachel Sklar",
      "quote": "I am pro-choice, but I don't consider that inconsistent at all with pro-life - there's no way that having an abortion, ever, is an easy decision, and it more often errs on the side of absolutely wrenching, not to mention physically debilitating."

      "cite": "Pope Francis",
      "quote": "Let us say \"Yes\" to life and not death. Let us say \"Yes\" to freedom and not enslavement to the many idols of our time. In a word, let us say \"Yes\" to the God who is love, life and freedom, and who never disappoints."

      "cite": "Mike Huckabee",

    },
    {
      "cite": "Pope John Paul II",
      "quote": "To be actively pro-life is to contribute to the renewal of society through the promotion of the common good.
