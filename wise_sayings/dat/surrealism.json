      "cite": "Andre Breton",
      "quote": "Surrealism\u00c2\u00a0does not allow those who devote themselves to it to forsake it whenever they like. There is every reason to believe that it acts on the mind very much as drugs do; like drugs, it creates a certain state of need and can push man to frightful revolts."

    {
      "cite": "Lorrie Moore",
      "quote": "Surrealism\u00c2\u00a0could not be made up. It was the very electricity of the real."

    {
      "cite": "Susan Sontag",
      "quote": "Surrealism\u00c2\u00a0is a bourgeois disaffection; that its militants thought it universal is only one of the signs that it is typically bourgeois."

    {
      "cite": "Graham Joyce",
      "quote": "The overintellectualization of surrealism can be a bromide. A dream interpreted is a deflated dream."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Cisco  Jimenez",
      "quote": "The key to surrealism is to create something apparently disparate and irrational that at the end has more sense than the objective world."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Sidra Stich",
      "quote": "Refusing to idealize, the Surrealists awakened a sensitivity to the arbitrary and the unusual.\u00c2"

    {
      "cite": "Salvador Dali",

    {
      "cite": "Octavio Paz",
      "quote": "Surrealism is not a poetry but a poetics, and even more, and more decisively, a world vision."

      "cite": "Rene Magritte",
      "quote": "To be a surrealist means barring from your mind all remembrance of what you have seen, and being always on the lookout for what has never been."

    {
      "cite": "Andre Breton",
      "quote": "Surrealism\u00c2\u00a0is based on the belief in the omnipotence of dreams, in the undirected play of thought."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Octavio Paz",
      "quote": "Surrealism\u00c2\u00a0is not a school of poetry but a movement of liberation... A way of rediscovering the language of innocence, a renewal of the primordial pact, poetry is the basic text, the foundation of the human order.\u00c2\u00a0Surrealism\u00c2\u00a0is revolutionary because it is a return to the beginning of all beginnings."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Salvador Dali",
      "quote": "Surrealism\u00c2\u00a0is destructive, but it destroys only what it considers to be shackles limiting our vision."

    {
      "cite": "Frida Kahlo",
      "quote": "Surrealism is the magical surprise of finding a lion in a wardrobe, where you were 'sure' of finding shirts."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Michael Richardson",
      "quote": "Surrealism, then, neither aims to subvert realism, as does the fantastic, nor does it try to transcend it. It looks for different means by which to explore reality itself."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Paul Nouge",
      "quote": "Surrealism, which fizzled as an autonomous doctrine, as a specific method, does not exist. But it remains an historical fact, a fire that illuminates the intellectual landscape of the horizon."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Andre Breton",
      "quote": "If surrealism ever comes to adopt a particular line of moral conduct, it has only to accept the discipline that Picasso has accepted and will continue to accept."

    {
      "cite": "Silvano Levy",
      "quote": "The stress in surrealism is always upon life and thought, not on literature or technique. To a surrealist everything is dictated by the place which art has in life. Art would lose its function if it were separated from the problems of everyday living."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Jean-Louis Bedouin",
      "quote": "Surrealism is born of a consciousness of the derisory condition allotted to the individual and his thought, and a refusal to accommodate oneself to it."

    {
      "cite": "Dawn Ades",
      "quote": "Surrealism sought to maintain its autonomy and the right to continue its own particular investigations into ways of changing consciousness, the role of the unconscious within the social body, and the current state of language both visual and verbal."
