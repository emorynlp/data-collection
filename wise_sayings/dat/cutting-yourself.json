      "quote": "The day I'd first cut myself, a switch in my head had been flicked. Instead of feeling horror, I felt nothing, and although I no longer wanted to hurt myself, my episodes of self-harm still felt normal for me in a way. I'd sometimes forget it still shocked other people."

      "cite": "Marya Hornbacher",

      "cite": "Nick Johnston",
      "quote": "Cutting myself was something beyond despair, something very extreme. It's about trying to get to something.

    },
    {
      "cite": "Caroline Kettlewell",
      "quote": "That\u2019s when I wanted to cut. I cut to quiet the cacophony. I cut to end this abstracted agony, to reel myself back to one present and physical whole, whose blood was the proof of her tangibility."

      "cite": "Amy Efaw",
      "quote": "In case you didn't know, dead people don't bleed. If you can bleed-see it, feel it-then you know you're alive. It's irrefutable, undeniable proof. Sometimes I just need a little reminder."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Caroline Kettlewell",
      "quote": "I needed cutting now the way a diabetic needs insulin. It was a bulwark, steady and unyielding, I could throw up against the insidious, corrosive lapping of a whispering sea of uneasiness."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Demi Lovato",
      "quote": "There were times I felt so anxious, almost like I was crawling out of my skin, that if I didn't do something physical to match the way I felt inside, I would explode. I cut myself to take my mind off that. I just didn't care what happened. I had no fear."

    {
      "cite": "Augusten Burroughs",
      "quote": "For exactly the same reason, it is sometimes satisfying to cut yourself and bleed. On those gray [sic] days where eight in the morning looks no different from noon and nothing has happened and nothing is going to happen and you are washing a glass in the sink and it breaks - accidentally - and punctures your skin. And then there is this shocking red, the brightest thing in the day, so vibrant it buzzes, this blood of yours. That is okay sometimes because at least you know you're alive."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Courtney Knowles",
      "quote": "Here\u2019s the thing\u2026all of us know what it feels like to hurt. We have times in our lives when we feel down, alone, not good enough, angry or anxious. Sometimes that pain comes from things happening around us, and sometimes it comes from the voices in our own heads. Finding a way to cope with those feelings isn\u2019t always easy \u2014 and sometimes we find ways to feel better\u2026that actually cause more pain. Like drinking too much, using unprescribed drugs and cutting or self-injury."

      "cite": "Kathleen Glasgow",
      "quote": "In a rush, it happens again, only this time it\u2019s remembering what it\u2019s like to cut, and cut hard. The way you have to dig the glass in, deeply, right away, to break the skin and then drag, and drag fiercely, to make a river worth drowning in."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Dr. Steingard",
      "quote": "They\u2019ve locked down so tightly because of whatever\u2019s going on in their lives that they feel they\u2019re incapable of feeling anything at all. So they hurt themselves in order to feel something."

      "cite": "Hannah Kwawu",
      "quote": "Many people interpret self-harm as a way of \u201cacting out\u201d or \u201clooking for attention.\u201d However, it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t stereotype\u2014pain does not discriminate and people of all ages and backgrounds can be at risk for self-harm."

      "cite": "Susanna Kaysen",
      "quote": "I know what it's like to want to die. How it hurts to smile. How you try to fit in, but you can't. How you hurt yourself on the outside to try to kill the thing on the inside."

    {
      "cite": "Blue",
      "quote": "A lot of people think that, but in reality, you cut for different reasons, like, it\u2019s the only way you know to deal with intense insecurities, or anger at yourself. Or you\u2019re so numb as a result of depression, you can\u2019t feel anything \u2014 and this is one thing you can feel."
