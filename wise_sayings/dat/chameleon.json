      "cite": "Bernard Rosen",
      "quote": "Being a successful chameleon is not easy. It takes concentration and luck, because a chameleon's path is strewn with mines. One misstep and all is over. Chameleons are always at risk. They cannot afford to lower their guard, even for a second. Skeptical adversaries may at any moment rip off their masks; a slip of the tongue may reveal their true intentions; someone may call the chameleon's bluff, and suddenly the game is up."

According to the legend, God decided, one day, to make man immortal, and sent the chameleon to tell man the good news. Then God changed his mind, and sent along another lizard with instructions to call off man's immortality \u2014 unless the chameleon had already arrived. But the chameleon was so poky that the other lizard got there long ahead of him, and this is how man lost his chance at immortality. Some people are still annoyed about it."

    {
      "cite": "Billy Graham",

      "cite": "Jennifer Goines",
      "quote": "That is not a woman. It's a chameleon. Whatever you see is what she wants you to see. And if she smiles at you, it's because she wants you dead. That isn't someone who's ever been anywhere she didn't want to be."
