      "quote": "Thou spring'st a leak already in thy crown, / A flaw is in thy ill-bak'd vessel found; / 'Tis hollow, and returns a jarring sound, / Yet thy moist clay is pliant to command, / Unwrought, and easy to the potter's hand: / Now take the mould; / now bend thy mind to feel / The first sharp motions of the forming wheel."

      "cite": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow",
      "quote": "Turn, turn, my wheel! Turn round and round / Without a pause, without a sound: / So spins the flying world away! / This clay, well mixed with marl and sand, / Follows the motion of my hand; / For some must follow, and some command, / Though all are made of clay!"

      "quote": "African men don't understand professional women; they're not used to women in the arts... as long as the pottery's done by hand, it remains a women's craft. As soon as machinery takes over, so do the men. This happens to most crafts and technologies, including the making of china in the Potteries in England."

      "cite": "Oscar Wilde",
      "quote": "I saw some designs on your vases done by someone who, I should say, had only five minutes to catch a train... the institution of pottery should not be a refuge for people who  cannot draw nor asylum for the artistically afflicted."

      "quote": "When I see a shard of pottery, I often think to myself, \u201cWho ate off that?\u201d Before I know it, I am transported to a wealthy Victorian family\u2019s dining room, sharing dinner with them on the plate that I just found on the river foreshore. Another shard, and I am whisked away to the table of a Roman family living alongside the river, missing home."

      "cite": "Jennie Jieun Lee",
      "quote": "Hours can pass without thinking or caring about anything else\u2014that\u2019s what is known as the \u2018potter\u2019s nod. It\u2019s a feeling that\u2019s very similar to being at the mercy of a wonderful drug, except in this case, it\u2019s a holistic antidepressant."

      "cite": "John Sheppard",
      "quote": "You have to be in tune with the clay and react to what state it\u2019s in to work with it."
    },
    {
      "cite": "John Sheppard",
      "quote": "It\u2019s very meditative. It turns off a higher level of thinking. You have to let go and give in to the unpredictability of it. You can go in with an idea of what you want to make, and the clay doesn\u2019t want to do that."

      "cite": "Helen Levi",
      "quote": "It\u2019s always been popular, it\u2019s just become more so with the farm-to-table movement."

    {
      "cite": "Elizabeth Macneal",
      "quote": "There were about 100 people on the project I was working on. I had no idea what I was even supposed to be doing. But, with pottery, you are solely responsible for how it turns out. That\u2019s so inviting when you\u2019re disaffected by your job."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Tallie Maughan",
      "quote": "Ceramics is the oldest form of technology we have. After cooking meat, baking clay was the first thing that humans did to chemically alter our environment on purpose. You can\u2019t make rice without cooking it in some kind of vessel, so clay pots go hand in hand with agriculture \u2013 our whole evolution is connected to it. There\u2019s only a short period of history in which people haven\u2019t been connected with pottery. There\u2019s something incredibly grounding about an experience that connects you with the past like that."

    {
      "cite": "Edith Wharton",
      "quote": "Here in the jealous hollow of the mould, / Faint, light-eluding, as templed in the breast / Of some rose-vaulted lotus, see the best / The artist had - the vision that unrolled / Its flying sequence till completion's hold / Caught the wild round and bade the dancers rest - / The mortal lip on the immortal pressed / One instant, ere the blindness and the cold. / And there the vase: immobile, exiled, tame, / The captives of fulfillment link their round, / Foot-heavy on the inelastic ground, / How different, yet how enviously the same! / Dishonoring the kinship that they claim, / As here the written word the inner sound."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Laozi",
      "quote": "Clay is molded to form a cup, But it is on its non-being that the utility of the cup depends. Doors and windows are cut out to make a room, But it is on its non-being that the utility of the room depends. Therefore turn being into advantage, and turn non-being into utility."

    {
      "cite": "Laozi",
      "quote": "Clay is used to make vases, but it is the emptiness they contain that makes them useful."

    {
      "cite": "Laozi",
      "quote": "Shape clay into a vessel; It is the space within that makes it useful. Cut doors and windows for a room; It is the holes which make it useful. Therefore benefit comes from what is there; Usefulness from what is not there."

      "quote": "A field of clay touched by the genius of man becomes a castle."

      "quote": "A clay pot sitting in the sun will always be a clay pot. It has to go though the white heat of the furnace to become porcelain."
