      "cite": "Ben Hecht",

    {
      "cite": "Adam Smith",
      "quote": "Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions."

    {
      "cite": "Samuel Smiles",
      "quote": "He who recognizes no higher logic than that of the shilling may become a very rich man, and yet remain all the while an exceedingly poor creature; for riches are no proof whatever of moral worth, and their glitter often serves only to draw attention to the worthlessness of their possessor, as the glow-worm's light reveals the grub."

      "cite": "Theodore Roosevelt",

      "cite": "Michael Oondatje",
      "quote": "Why are you not smarter? It's only the rich who can't afford to be smart. They're compromised. They got locked years ago into privilege. They have to protect their belongings. No one is meaner than the rich. Trust me. But they have to follow the rules of their sh\u2014 civilized world."

      "cite": "Warren Buffett",
      "quote": "There\u2019s class warfare, all right, but it\u2019s my class, the rich class, that\u2019s making war, and we\u2019re winning."

    {
      "cite": "Robert G. Ingersoll",
      "quote": "I do not see how it is possible for a man to die worth fifty million of dollars, or ten million of dollars, in a city full of want, when he meets almost every day the withered hand of beggary and the white lips of famine. How a man can withstand all that, and hold in the clutch of his greed twenty or thirty million of dollars, is past my comprehension. I do not see how he can do it. I should not think he could do it any more than he could keep a pile of lumber on the beach, where hundreds and thousands of men were drowning in the sea."

      "cite": "Justin K. McFarlane Beau",

      "cite": "Thomas Jefferson",
      "quote": "Experience demands that man is the only animal which devours his own kind, for I can apply no milder term to the general prey of the rich on the poor."

    {
      "cite": "Robert Baden-Powell",
      "quote": "You may be rich, but there is one thing you can't afford - that is, if you are a good sort - you can't afford to spend money on your own luxuries while there are people around you wanting the necessaries of life."

      "cite": "Logan Pearsall Smith",
      "quote": "To suppose as we all suppose, that we could be rich and not behave as the rich behave, is like supposing that we could drink all day and stay sober."

      "cite": "Daniel Defoe",
      "quote": "A rich man is an honest man\u2014no thanks to him; for he would be a double knave, to cheat mankind when he had no need of it: he has no occasion to press upon his integrity, nor so much as to touch upon the borders of dishonesty."
