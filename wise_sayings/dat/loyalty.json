    },
    {
      "cite": "General Colin Powell",
      "quote": "Loyalty means giving me your honest opinion, whether you think I'll like it or not. Disagreement, at this state, stimulates me. But once a decision is made, the debate ends. From that point on, loyalty means executing the decision as if it were your own."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Elbert Hubbard",

      "cite": "Maurice R. Franks",
      "quote": "Loyalty cannot be blueprinted. It cannot be produced on an assembly line. In fact, it cannot be manufactured at all, for its origin is the human heart-the center of self-respect and human dignity. It is a force which leaps into being only when conditions are exactly right for it-and it is a force very sensitive to betrayal."

    {
      "cite": "Clarence Francis",

    {
      "cite": "Eric Felten",
      "quote": "If loyalty is, and always has been, perceived as obsolete, why do we continue to praise it? Because loyalty is essential to the most basic things that make life livable. Without loyalty there can be no love. Without loyalty there can be no family. Without loyalty there can be no friendship. Without loyalty there can be no commitment to community or country. And without those things, there can be no society."

    {
      "cite": "Anonymous",
      "quote": "Don't let your loyalty become slavery. If they don't appreciate what you bring to the table, let them eat alone."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Eric Felten",
      "quote": "Our modern, rootless times do seem to be a particularly inhospitable environment for loyalty. We come and go so relentlessly that our friendships can't but come and go too. What sort of loyalty is there in the age of Facebook, when friendship is a costless transaction, a business of flip reciprocity.... Friendship held together by nothing more permanent than hyperlinks is hardly the stuff of selfless fidelity."

    {
      "cite": "Mark Twain",
      "quote": "Loyalty to a petrified opinion never yet broke a chain or freed a human soul."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Algernon Charles Swinburne",
      "quote": "The highest spiritual quality, the noblest property of mind a man can have, is this of loyalty ... a man with no loyalty in him, with no sense of love or reverence or devotion due to something outside and above his poor daily life, with its pains and pleasures, profits and losses, is as evil a case as man can be."

    {
      "cite": "Samuel Goldwyn",
      "quote": "I'll take fifty percent efficiency to get one hundred percent loyalty."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Neil Kinnock",
      "quote": "Loyalty is a fine quality, but in excess it fills political graveyards."
    },

      "cite": "Mark Twain",
      "quote": "Loyalty to the country always. Loyalty to the government when it deserves it."

    {
      "cite": "Thomas Cochrane",
      "quote": "Loyalty to the family must be merged into loyalty to the community, loyalty to the community into loyalty to the nation, and loyalty to the nation into loyalty to mankind. The citizen of the future must be a citizen of the world."
