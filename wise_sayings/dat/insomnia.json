Or can it be that love has stolen into me and cunningly works my harm with covered art? Thus it must be; the subtle darts are planted in my heart, and cruel love torments the breast where he is lord."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Emil Cioran",
      "quote": "True knowledge comes down to vigils in the darkness: the sum of our insomnias alone distinguishes us from the animals and from our kind. What rich or strange idea was ever the work of a sleeper?"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Emil Cioran",
      "quote": "The importance of insomnia is so colossal that I am tempted to define man as the animal that cannot sleep. Why call him a rational animal when other animals are equally reasonable? But there is not another animal in the entire creation that wants to sleep yet cannot."

      "cite": "Emil Cioran",
      "quote": "Sleep is forgetfulness: life\u2019s drama, its complications and obsessions vanish completely, and every awakening is a new beginning, a new hope. Life thus maintains a pleasant discontinuity, the illusions of permanent regeneration. Insomnia, on the other hand, gives birth to a feeling of irrevocable sadness, despair, and agony. The healthy man \u2013 the animal \u2013 only dabbles in insomnia: he knows nothing of those who would give a kingdom for an hour of unconscious sleep, those as terrified by the sight of a bed as they would be of a torture rack."
    },

      "cite": "Gordon Marino",
      "quote": "What rich or strange idea was ever the work of a sleeper? In those weird hours, out of sync with the rest of the world, his singular creativity flourished. The experience wasn't much fun, but it was real."

      "quote": "I asked my psychiatrist how he cured his insomnia. He said he changed his phone number."
    },
    {
      "cite": "The BMJ",
      "quote": "The subject of sleeplessness is once more under public discussion. The hurry and excitement of modern life is held to be responsible for much of the insomnia of which we hear; and most of the articles and letters are full of good advice to live more quietly and of platitudes concerning the harmfulness of rush and worry. The pity of it is that so many people are unable to follow this good advice and are obliged to lead a life of anxiety and high tension."

      "cite": "Daniel Saint",
      "quote": "Insomnia is just another word for chit chat with the demons during bedtime."

    {
      "cite": "Theo",
      "quote": "You know what, the rest of you may hate your insomnia but I'm not sure I want a cure for mine. That's when I get all my best ideas... I'm alone, occasionally... with no distractions. My mind is racing with creative ideas and come 3am I feel like a genius."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Daniel Rankine and Paul Ridge",
      "quote": "Insomnia / I can't eat, feeling the heat, can't sleep / Insomnia / It's just me and the sounds of police on the street / Insomnia / No retreat cause I never thought it'd happen to me."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Matthew Kelly Sharp",
      "quote": "Ever find yourself awake / In the middle of the night / You've got insomnia / Grab a glass of water / Or a cigarette for your insomnia / But I know something that's so much better yet / Just grab the bong and numb your brain with pot / Watch Cal Worthington and his dog Spot / Insomnia, yeah it's so boring / Nothing to do at three o'clock in the morning / You can get dressed, go out for a walk / For your insomnia / But that's just asking for hassles / From your neighborhood cops / You've got insomnia."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Christopher Joseph Gallant; Ricardo Valentine; Ajay Bhattacharyya",
      "quote": "Sweet insomnia / You make it hard for me to sleep by myself / Sweet insomnia / You make it hard for me to know myself."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Jonathan Elkaer; Mads Bo Iversen; Awinbeh Ayagiba",
      "quote": "I sleep walk on the walls / Counting stars all over town / Always up, insomnia / Zombie walk, eyes never shut."
