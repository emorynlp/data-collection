      "cite": "Reiner Maria Rilke",
      "quote": "Physical pleasure is a sensual experience no different from pure seeing or the pure sensation with which a fine fruit fills the tongue; it is a great unending experience, which is given us, a knowing of the world, the fullness and the glory of all knowing.

      "cite": "Elana Millman",
      "quote": "Sensuality relates to how we can move, shake, and beguile our (desired) beloved into a deeper sense of communion. It\u2019s a well-timed wink, the hug of cashmere on subtle curves, or the undulation of aromatherapy for sensual living sensuality and our senses hips on a dance floor. It\u2019s salacious confidence seen in the way we hold ourselves in our bodies and in our lives."
