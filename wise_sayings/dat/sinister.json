      "cite": "Jean de La Bruy\u00e8re",
      "quote": "To speak and to offend, with some people, are but one and the same thing; their words are fraught with gall and wormwood, from a proud, splenetic, and malevolent disposition; it had been well for them, had they been born stupid or mute; the little vivacity and wit they have, prejudice them more than dulness does others. They are not always satisfied with giving sharp answers; they insolently attack the present, and wound the character of the absent; they bristle up and butt on all sides like rams; and impudence being as natural to them as horns to a ram, no ridicule, no satire, can work upon these untractable savages; we had better at first sight betake ourselves to our heels, and by a prudent flight avoid their molestations."
