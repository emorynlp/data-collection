      "quote": "If Syria is to rise from the ashes it needs a united Arab world which has one thing on its agenda, not the falling of a dictator for we have seen many of those fall, but the reemergence of a prosperous Arab nation, one that is not reliant on foreign aid but is self-sustained and set on its way to become powerful once again."

      "cite": "Chauhan Saab",
      "quote": "So from the broken smile to the sealed emotion, From the rising hope to the failed redemption, From the still mornings to the chaotic nights, From the fallen peace to the terror sights, From the cursed skies to the soil red stained, Hear the silent cries, I'm the Syrian pain."
