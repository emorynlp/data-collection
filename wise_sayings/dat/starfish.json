      "cite": "Peter Watts",
      "quote": "A multi colored starfish, beautifully twisted, stitched together from leftovers. It lies folded back against itself, two arms facing upward; a few remaining tube feet wave feebly in the current. Cottony fungus thrives in a jagged patchwork of seams."

      "cite": "Janette Halfmann",
      "quote": "When she takes too long, the tide flows back without her. And the Sea Star became easy prey for a seagull. But she is built to survive and returns to the sea, although with one less ray."

      "cite": "Janette Halfmann",
      "quote": "She inches along, twisting her body flat like a pretzel. Her mouth is on her underside, and  she doesn't have a head or tail end. Tiny red eyespots at the tips of her rays tell her light from dark. She leads first with one ray, then another, heading for the mussels growing halfway up the shore."
