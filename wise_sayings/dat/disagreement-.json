      "cite": "Emily Eskowich",
      "quote": "A conversation in which the two parties have different beliefs should never begin with the intention of converting the other party to your own beliefs. Every worthwhile conversation's goal should be to understand the other person's opinions and help them understand your own."

      "cite": "Ashly Lorenzana",
      "quote": "It's okay to disagree with the thoughts or opinions expressed by other people. That doesn't give you the right to deny any sense they might make. Nor does it give you a right to accuse someone of poorly expressing their beliefs just because you don't like what they are saying. Learn to recognize good writing when you read it, even if it means overcoming your pride and opening your mind beyond what is comfortable."

    {
      "cite": "Ron Baratono",
      "quote": "Staying relevant and speaking in kind tones is by far, the best way to make your point. The moment you lose track, throwing out a negative comment you\u2019ve lost your way, and get the terrible task of carrying your own negative, regretful baggage around with you. It\u2019s senseless to create your own heavy heart."

      "cite": "William J. Clinton",
      "quote": "You should have disagreements with your leaders and your colleagues, but if it becomes immediately a question of questioning people's motives, and if immediately you decide that somebody who sees a whole new situation differently than you must be a bad person and somehow twisted inside, we are not going to get very far in forming a more perfect union."
