      "quote": "Once you can squat with 180 kilograms, your arms and shoulders will come along much more receptively...If you want big arms and shoulders, your first priority is to be sure that your leg/hip/back structure is growing and becoming powerful."

      "cite": "Chasers Holmes",
      "quote": "Weight lifting is about lifting the impossible, overcoming the unachievable. If you don't lift things that are hard, and only do the things you can do, it's only going to get boring. Unless you want to lift beyond your limits to get stronger, to achieve new goals, and to be satisfied, you got to lift past these challenges, and still lift the things you think are impossible to really understand how your true strength will show. Lift how I lift, see how I lift, watch how I lift, learn how I lift, and your true strength will come forth and be revealed"

    {
      "cite": "Victoria Pendleton",
      "quote": "If you start lifting weights, you will expect to put weight on, as muscle is heavier than fat. But you have to look more at your body shape - you will get heavier - but you might get smaller and heavier at the same time, which is fine. And it doesn't really matter what you weigh as long as you are happy with your shape and size!"

      "quote": "If you think lifting weights is dangerous, try being weak. Being weak is dangerous."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Greg Everett",
      "quote": "Any program will produce gains in a beginning weightlifter--these easily-obtained improvements shouldn't be the primary goal, however. The more important goal for beginning and intermediate training programs is to establish a proper foundation that will allow maximal long term improvements."

      "cite": "Wesley Silveira",
      "quote": "Working chest, delts, tris, and biceps works approximately 10% of your overall lean body mass. Working hard on deadlifts (bent legged, trap Bar, or sumo) or squatting (not necessarily at the same time) works more like 70% of your musculature at once and sends a strong message to your body to get better at growing now!"

    {
      "cite": "Mark Sanchez",
      "quote": "Lifting weights is obviously important, because you want to be strong and fast and all of that, but it's not one of those things you gotta go and try to bench as much as you can every day. A bench press isn't going to help you throw a 15-yard out or a deep comeback. It's not about that. It's about training right."

    {
      "cite": "Stephen Covey",
      "quote": "Opposition is a natural part of life. Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition - such as lifting weights - we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity."
