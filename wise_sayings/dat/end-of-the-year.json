    },
    {
      "cite": "Zadie Smith",
      "quote": "This, after all, was the month in which families began tightening and closing and sealing; from Thanksgiving to the New Year, everybody's world contracted, day by day, into the microcosmic single festive household, each with its own rituals and obsessions, rules and dreams. . . . How does one cry for help from these seasonal prisons?"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Jay Leno",
      "quote": "Women get a little more excited about New Year's Eve than men do. It's like an excuse: You get drunk; you make a lot of promises you're not going to keep; the next morning as soon as you wake up you start breaking them. For men, we just call that a date."

    {
      "cite": "John Brand",
      "quote": "As the vulgar . . . are always very careful to end the old year well, so they are no less solicitous of making a good beginning of the new one. The old one is ended with a hearty compotation. The new one is opened with the custom of sending presents, which are termed New Year's Gifts, to friends and acquaintance."

    {
      "cite": "Henry Ward Beecher",
      "quote": "Every man should be born again on the first day of January. Start with a fresh page.

    },
    {
      "cite": "Jack Santino",
      "quote": "These year's-end holidays have in them the quality of transition that we find in other festivals of the new year, no matter when they are celebrated. Yom Kippur marks the end of the solemn days and the beginning of the regular days of the new year. The Ten Days, during which the gates of heaven are open, are a time out of time, a period of liminality during which people can shape their destinies, retract vows and right wrongs. In short one can make oneself over for the new year, in a way that recalls, however dimly, the custom of New Year's resolutions."
    },
    {
      "cite": "William Everson",
      "quote": "I leave this year as a man leaves wine, / Remembering the summer bountiful, the good fall, the months mellow and full. / I sit in the northern room, in the dusk, the death of a year, / And watch it go down in thunder."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Christopher Perry",
      "quote": "The end of the year is always a good time to reflect on our spiritual progress. Whether you set goals at the beginning of this year or not, it is certainly good to ask where you have been this year and whether you are heading in the right direction."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Howard Thurman",
      "quote": "Because life is dynamic and we are deeply alive, the end of the year can only mean the end of the year, not the end of life, not the end of us, not even the end of time. We turn our faces toward the year being born with a riding hope that will carry us into the days ahead with courage and with confidence. The old year dies; the new year is being born  \u2060\u2014 Long live Life!"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Matthew Murphy; Tom Overland Knudsen; Dan Haggis",

      "cite": "James Weldon Johnson",
      "quote": "What does this brazen tongue declare, / That falling on the midnight air / Brings to my heart a sense of care / Akin to fright? / 'Tis telling that the year is dead, / The New Year come, the Old Year fled, / Another leaf before me spread / On which to write."
    },
    {
      "cite": "John Clare",
      "quote": "Old papers thrown away, / Old garments cast aside, / The talk of yesterday, / All things identified; / But times once torn away / No voices can recall: / The eve of New Year's Day / Left the Old Year lost to all."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Edith Nesbit",
      "quote": "And now the year is done \u2060\u2014 its pleasure / So brief, so bright \u2060\u2014 its hours of pain; / Some moments' memories we treasure, / Some recollections loathe in vain."
