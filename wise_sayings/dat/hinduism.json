      "cite": "Hanya Yanagihara",
      "quote": "No religion makes more use of color than Hinduism, with its blue-skinned gods and peony-lipped goddesses, and even the spring festival of Holi is focused on color: Boys squirt arcs of dyed water on passersby or dump powder, all violently hued, on their marks."

      "cite": "Mahatma Gandhi",
      "quote": "Hinduism is a relentless pursuit of Truth. Truth is God and if today it has become moribund, inactive, irresponsive to growth, it is because we are fatigued; and as soon as the fatigue is over, Hinduism will burst upon the world with a brilliance perhaps unknown before."

      "cite": "Amit Ray",
      "quote": "Brahman is the ultimate reality; it is simultaneously Saguna and Nirguna; divisions are due to ignorance. Mind and intellect can never catch hold of it; they have only one option and that is to merge with it."

    },
    {
      "cite": "George Bernard Shaw",
      "quote": "Hinduism is so elastic and subtle that the most profound Methodist and crudest Idolator are equally at home with it."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Nancy Wilson Ross",
      "quote": "Plainly, contemporary Western science's description of an astronomical universe of such vast magnitude that distances must be measured in terms as abstract as light-years is not new to Hinduism whose wise men, millennia ago, came up with the term kalpa to signify the inconceivable duration of the period elapsing between the beginning and end of a world system."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Aleksandr Zinovyev",

    {
      "cite": "Annie Besant",
      "quote": "Make no mistake, without Hinduism, India has no future. Hinduism is the soil in to which India's roots are stuck and torn out of that she will inevitably wither as a tree torn out from its place. And if Hindus do not maintain Hinduism who shall save it? India alone can save India and India and Hinduism are one."

    {
      "cite": "Henry David Thoreau",
      "quote": "The reader is nowhere raised into and sustained in a bigger, purer or rarer region of thought than in the Bhagavad-Gita. The Gita's sanity and sublimity have impressed the minds of even soldiers and merchants."

      "cite": "K.S. Murty",
      "quote": "Modern exponents of Hinduism should make it explicit that such statements as 'All religions are true' are made only on their own authority, and do not represent the orthodox Hindu tradition."
    },
    {
      "cite": "A.L. Basham",
      "quote": "A holy trinity of Hinduism, the Trim rti or triple form, was evolved, of Brahm the creator, Visnu the preserver, and Siva the destroyer... Early western students of Hinduism were impressed by the parallel between the Hindu trinity and that of Christianity. In fact the parallel is not very close, and the Hindu trinity, unlike the Holy Trinity of Christianity, never really 'caught on'. All Hindu trinitarianism tended to favour one god of the three."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Mahatma Gandhi",
      "quote": "For reforms of Hinduism and for its real protection, removal of untouchability is the greatest thing... Removal of untouchability is... a spiritual process."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Mahatma Gandhi",
      "quote": "Hinduism rules out indulgences and multiplication of wants, as these hamper one's growth to the ultimate identity with the Universal Self."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Mahatma Gandhi",
      "quote": "Hinduism is not an exclusive religion. In it, there is room for the worship of all the prophets of the world. It is not a missionary religion in the ordinary sense of the term. ... Hinduism tells everyone to worship God according to his own faith or dharma, and so it lives at peace with all religions."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Jiddu Krishnamurthi",
      "quote": "He sounds mean, doesn't he? But really, Shiva is a compassionate god, because in Hinduism, the destroyer of life is also the bringer of life. So what Shiva destroys, he renews and restores."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Kasturba Gandhi",
      "quote": "In Hindu philosophy the way to God is to free yourself of possessions, and the passions that inflame anger and jealousy. Bapu has always struggled to find the way to God."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Alfred Comyn Lyall",
      "quote": "Here, in this mystical India, the deities hover and swarm / Like the wild bees heard in the treetops, or the gusts of a gathering storm; / In the air men hear their voices, their feet on the rocks are seen, / Yet we all say, \u201cWhence is the message, and what may the wonders mean?\u201d"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Sadhguru",
      "quote": "Being a Hindu does not mean having a particular belief system. It is only recently and due to external influences that this geographical and cultural identity has attempted to transform itself into a religious identity called Hinduism. Hindu was never an \u201cism\u201d, and the attempt to organize it as a religion is still not successful because the Hindu way of life which is referred to as Sanatana Dharma or universal law is all-inclusive in nature and does not exclude anything. The Hindu way of life is not an organized belief system but a science of salvation."
