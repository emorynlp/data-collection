      "cite": "Stephen Hawking",
      "quote": "If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans.... We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet."

      "cite": "Dwight Schultz",
      "quote": "UFO's' attitude toward the subject is very similar to mine. It's not an advocacy; its philosophy is more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI want to believe this, but I want it proved."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Rekha Sharma",
      "quote": "I believe there's other forms of intelligence in the universe. I've seen and heard some pretty convincing UFO stuff. Besides, if we're the most intelligent things in the universe\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 well, that's just depressing."

    {
      "cite": "John Ankerberg",
      "quote": "But the\u00c2\u00a0UFO\u00c2\u00a0phenomenon simply does not behave like extraterrestrial visitors. It actually molds itself in order to fit a given culture."

    {
      "cite": "Toba Beta",
      "quote": "There is no\u00c2\u00a0UFO\u00c2\u00a0and also there is no alien, at least not in common mind nor reference."

      "cite": "John A. Keel",
      "quote": "The\u00c2\u00a0UFO\u00c2\u00a0manifestations seem to be, by and large, merely minor variations of the age-old demonological phenomenon."

    {
      "cite": "Isaac Asimov",
      "quote": "The energy requirements for interstellar travel are so great that it is inconceivable to me that any creatures piloting their ships across the vast depths of space would do so only in order to play games with us over a period of decades. If they want to make contact, they would make contact; if not, they would save their energy and go elsewhere."

      "cite": "Arthur C. Clarke",
      "quote": "The phenomenon of\u00c2\u00a0UFO\u00c2\u00a0doesn't say anything about the presence of intelligence in space. It just shows how rare it is here on the earth."

    {
      "cite": "Azim Daudpota",
      "quote": "This was no ordinary\u00c2\u00a0UFO. Scores of people saw it. It was no illusion, no deception, no imagination."

    {
      "cite": "Stephen Hawking",
      "quote": "I am discounting reports of UFOs. Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos?"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Paul Kurtz",
      "quote": "UFO mythology is similar to the message of the classical religions where God sends his Angels as emissaries who offer salvation to those who accept the faith and obey his Prophets. Today, the chariots of the gods are UFOs. What we are witnessing in the past half century is the spawning of a New Age religion."

      "cite": "Toba Beta",
      "quote": "Regarding alien beings and\u00c2\u00a0UFO\u00c2\u00a0sightings, They're less about 'where' or 'when' to find, more about 'how' or using 'what' to identify."
    },

      "cite": "Toba Beta",
      "quote": "You see a lot of UFOs with closed eyes and opened mind."
