      "quote": "The image of the Goddess inspires women to see ourselves as divine, our bodies as sacred, the changing phases of our lives as holy, our aggression as healthy, our anger as purifying, and our power to nurture and create, but also to limit and destroy when necessary, as the very force that sustains all life. Through the Goddess we can discover our strength, enlighten our minds, own our bodies, and celebrate our emotions. We can move beyond narrow, constricting roles and become whole."

So they concern themselves with chasing money. But they have it backwards. You have to give your heart to the Goddess of Wisdom, give her all your love and attention, and the Goddess of Wealth will become jealous, and follow you.\u201d Ask nothing from your running, in other words, and you\u2019ll get more than you ever imagined."

She is the Mother and Destroyer; He is all that is born and is destroyed."

Be this as it may, I know that I can feel the heart-throbs of the ancient Greeks in their marble gods and goddesses."
