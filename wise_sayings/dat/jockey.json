      "quote": "A good jockey has to be physically well balanced. They have to possess a strong upper body and a strong lower body.

      "quote": "There is little to compare with the thrill of standing next to the creature in the winner\u2019s enclosure avoiding his hooves and receiving congratulations of the press, your trainer and friends who backed it. What makes the experience so satisfying is that you, the owner, have had absolutely nothing to do with the horse winning."

      "cite": "Jenny Pitman",
      "quote": "If you want to understand the effect of weight on a horse, try running for a bus with nothing in your hands. Then try doing it with your hands full of shopping. Then think about doing that for four-and-a-half miles."

      "quote": "A good jockey is one who settles his mount into a rhythm that even the most casual observer can notice. If a jockey is bouncing around on a horse like a pinball machine, then the horse has something to think about other than running."
