      "cite": "Adam Michnik",
      "quote": "Pacifism as a mass movement aims to avoid suffering; pacifists often say that no cause is worth suffering or dying for. The ethos of Solidarity is based on an opposite premise - that there are causes worth suffering and dying for."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Oscar Arias Sanchez",
      "quote": "How ironic for peacemaking efforts to discover that hatred is stronger for many than love; that the longing to achieve power through military victories makes so many men lose their reason, forget all shame, and betray history."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Albert Einstein",
      "quote": "The goal of pacifism is possible only though a supranational organization. To stand unconditionally for this cause is the criterion of true pacifism."

      "cite": "David Limbaugh",
      "quote": "Pacifism in the face of war is not only irresponsible - it is immoral. Refusing to meet force with force in the name of peace will beget not peace, but further death and destruction, the very violence the pacifists seek to avoid."

    {
      "cite": "Oswald Spengler",
      "quote": "Pacifism means letting the non-pacifists have control ... Pacifism will remain an ideal, war a fact. If the white races are resolved never to wage war again, the colored will act differently and become rulers of the world."

    {
      "cite": "George Orwell",
      "quote": "Pacifism is objectively pro-fascist. This is elementary common sense. If you hamper the war effort of one side, you automatically help out that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, 'he that is not with me is against me'."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Albert Einstein",
      "quote": "We must begin to inculcate our children against militarism by educating them in the spirit of pacifism. Our schoolbooks glorify war and conceal it's horror. I would teach peace rather than war."

    {
      "cite": "Dwight Macdonald",
      "quote": "Pacifism, to me, is primarily a way of actively struggling against injustice and inhumanity; My kind of pacifism may be called \"non-violent resistance\"."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Hal Duncan",
      "quote": "The conflict between pacifism and socialism ultimately reflects a greater quandary of how one engages with such a system."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Burt Prelutsky",
      "quote": "The main problem with pacifism is that it doesn't work in all situations. The main problem with pacifists is that they're convinced it does."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Pope Francis",
      "quote": "Peacemaking calls for courage, much more so than warfare."
    },
    {
      "cite": "George Carlin",
      "quote": "Pacifism is a nice idea but it can get you killed. We're not there yet. Evolution is slow, small pox is fast."
