      "quote": "If an EMT calls in with a brain or spinal trauma, just divert them to the nearest hospital. All you gotta do is stand around and keep the E.R. open. It's an administrative problem, not a medical one."

    {
      "cite": "Daniel Jose Older",
      "quote": "I didn\u2019t become an EMT to have a front-row seat to other people\u2019s tragedies. I did it because I knew the world was bleeding and so was I, and somewhere deep down inside I knew the only way to stop my own bleeding was to learn how to stop someone else\u2019s."

      "cite": "Michael Bloomberg",
      "quote": "On September 11, 2001, thousands of first responders heroically rushed to the scene and saved tens of thousands of lives. More than 400 of those first responders did not make it out alive. In rushing into those burning buildings, not one of them asked \"What God do you pray to?\" \"What beliefs do you hold?\""

      "cite": "Michael Stern",
      "quote": "When you first become an EMT, you are extremely gung-ho, with a sense that you save lives, ... You are the antidote to all of life's miseries. You make people rise from the dead. But when you are an EMT for a length of time, you come to the grim reality that the number of lives that you actually save are small. You stabilize people until they get to the hospital. You make sure they can breathe and don't bleed to death and nothing more."
