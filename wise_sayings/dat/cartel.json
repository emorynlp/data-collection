      "cite": "Elizabeth Warren",
      "quote": "You know, if you\u2019re caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you\u2019re going to go to jail. If it happens repeatedly, you may go to jail for the rest of your life. But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night, every single individual associated with this. I think that\u2019s fundamentally wrong."

Let government succor failures, and we shall be headed for stagnation and decline."
