      "cite": "James Baldwin",
      "quote": "Every day in the city, on the contrary \u2014 and I grew up in the city \u2014 involves a subtle divorce from reality. There is something a little terrifying about being forty stories in the air and looking around you, and you see nothing but walls, other skyscrapers, and you don't dare look down. And if you are on the ground, if you want to see the sky, you must make an effort of the will and look up. And if you do that, you are likely to be carried off to Bellevue \u2014 but that is another story."

      "cite": "John Ely Burchard",
      "quote": "The essence of the ideal city is that a wide variety of individuals living in it have a clear chance to live a richly individualistic life if they want to; and I project this still further to include in the essence the stipulation that the humane city shall itself have individuality."

      "cite": "Victor Burgin",
      "quote": "Our relations with cities are like our relations with people. We love them, hate them, or are indifferent toward them. On our first day in a city that is new to us, we go looking for the city. We go down this street, around that corner. We are aware of the faces of passers-by. But the city eludes us, and we become uncertain whether we are looking for a city, or for a person."

      "quote": "For us who live in cities Nature is not natural. Nature is supernatural. Just as monks watched and strove to get a glimpse of heaven, so we watch and strive to get a glimpse of earth. It is as if men had cake and wine every day but were sometimes allowed common bread."
