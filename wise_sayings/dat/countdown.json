      "cite": "Emily Giffin",
      "quote": "The feeling I have reminds me of New Year\u2019s Eve, when the countdown is coming and I\u2019m not quite sure whether to grab my camera or just live in the moment. Usually I grab the camera and later regret it when the picture doesn\u2019t turn out. Then I feel enormously let down and think to myself that the night would have been more fun if it didn\u2019t mean quite so much, if I weren\u2019t forced to analyze where I\u2019ve been and where I\u2019m going."

      "cite": "James Scheibli",
      "quote": "While knowledge helps us understand how limited our time is, wisdom comes from embracing the finite. I encourage you to celebrate every birthday like a teen counting down the days to their inevitable independence. Celebrate like someone who just turned old enough to legally have a drink. Celebrate like somebody who gets to start collecting social security this year. Just celebrate. Life is too short, dammit!"

      "cite": "Simon Armitage",
      "quote": "Then the Chinese whisper of a countdown spreads across the crowd, first to be lit by a century's morning, mad to say they were there and then when the moment came, wild for the starlight that passes for meaning."

      "cite": "Yixing",
      "quote": "30 years old isn\u2019t my countdown but every day is the countdown of my life\u2014 forever is too short, there are too many things I want to do, I\u2019m being too greedy again."

      "quote": "Is the Armageddon / Finally here at last / You may see the mushroom / But you won't hear the blast / Don't need a self made prophet / Don't need a holy war / Don't need another D-day / To even up the score / I'm cursed with living on a goldmine / The doomsday clock was built by mankind / No place to run / Countdown's begun"

      "cite": "Lindsey Buckingham",
      "quote": "I'm waiting on the countdown / Sitting in the shade / Things about to turn around / How the madness fades / Oh, I've been waiting on the countdown / Things about to turn around / And now I'm out of the lost and found / Just waiting on the countdown / Time slips away / Oh, this feeling lingers / Right here I'm going to stay / I've been waiting on the countdown / Things about to turn around / And now I'm out of the lost and found / Just waiting on the countdown / So I'm sitting in the shade / Under the dreaming tree / Now the madness fades / Right here I'm going to be / Oh, I've been waiting on the countdown / Things about to turn around / And now I'm out of the lost and found / Just waiting on the countdown"

      "quote": "Ne'er ask the hour -- what is it to us / How Time deals out his treasures? / The golden moments lent us thus / Are not his coin, but Pleasure's. / If counting them o'er could add to their blisses, / I'd number each glorious second: / But moments of joy are, like Lesbia's kisses, / Too quick and sweet to be reckon'd. / Then fill the cup -- what is it to us / How time his circle measures? / The fairy hours we call up thus / Obey no wand but Pleasure's."

      "cite": "Lady Diana",
      "quote": "I miss the old you / where did my lover go / did I lose you in the mist of our love growing into something beautiful / a lifetime of endless love and forgiveness / where did we go wrong / did we mistreat our hearts out of love / I miss you everyday / so close to me but millions of galaxies away / I'm counting down the days when we reconnect our souls and create an eternal bond together / till then I will miss the old you my lover"

      "cite": "Henry Lawson",
      "quote": "The night too quickly passes / And we are growing old, / So let us fill our glasses / And toast the Days of Gold; / When finds of wondrous treasure / Set all the South ablaze, / And you and I were faithful mates / All through the roaring days!"

      "cite": "Lesbia Harford",
      "quote": "I count the days until I see you, dear, / But the days only. / I dare not reckon up the nights and hours / I shall be lonely. / But when at last I meet you, dearest heart, / How can it cheer me? / Desire has power to turn me into stone, / When you come near me. / I give my heart the lie against my will, / Seem not to see you, / Glance aside quickly if I meet your eye, / Love you and flee you."

      "quote": "We know story collections end when they end, as well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the pages serving as a countdown \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but nevertheless the standard story anthology hews closer to what makes being human so hard: it reminds you with each story how quickly everything we are, everything we call our lives can change, can be upended, can disappear. Never to return."
