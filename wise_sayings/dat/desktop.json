      "cite": "Douglas Adams",
      "quote": "First we thought the PC was a calculator. Then we found out how to turn numbers into letters with ASCII \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and we thought it was a typewriter. Then we discovered graphics, and we thought it was a television. With the World Wide Web, we've realized it's a brochure."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Steve Jobs",
      "quote": "The desktop metaphor was invented because one, you were a stand-alone device, and two, you had to manage your own storage. That's a very big thing in a desktop world. And that may go away. You may not have to manage your own storage. You may not store much before too long."

      "cite": "Bill Gates",
      "quote": "Personal computing today is a rich ecosystem encompassing massive PC-based data centers, notebook and Tablet PCs, handheld devices, and smart cell phones.

      "cite": "Walter Isaacson",
      "quote": "People know how to deal with a desktop intuitively. If you walk into an office, there are papers on the desk. The one on the top is the most important. People know how to switch priority. Part of the reason we model our computers on metaphors like the desktop is that we can leverage this experience people already have."
