      "cite": "John Noble",
      "quote": "Mars tugs at the human imagination like no other planet. With a force mightier than gravity, it attracts the eye to the shimmering red presence in the clear night sky."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Paul Davies",
      "quote": "A permanent base on Mars would have a number of advantages beyond being a bonanza for planetary science and geology. If, as some evidence suggests, exotic micro-organisms have arisen independently of terrestrial life, studying them could revolutionise biology, medicine and biotechnology."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Andy Weir",
      "quote": "The planet's famous red colour is from iron oxide coating everything. So it's not just a desert. It's a desert so old it's literally rusting."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Johannes Kepler",
      "quote": "The most true path of the planet Mars is an ellipse, which D\u00c3\u00bcrer also calls an oval, or certainly so close to an ellipse that the difference is insensible."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Seth Shostak",
      "quote": "Mars still remains the astrobiology community's number one choice for 'nearest rock with life,' but there are many researchers who argue that the moons of Jupiter are better bets. In particular, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are all thought to hide vast oceans of liquid water beneath their icy, outer skins."

    {
      "cite": "Buzz Aldrin",
      "quote": "Mars is the symbolic and totally stimulating next objective that could so dominate the next century's exploration efforts. From Mars, the resources of all the asteroids will become readily available."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Buzz Aldrin",
      "quote": "Mars has a bit of air pressure; maybe we can build up that atmosphere to be a bit more accommodating to humans."
    },
    {
      "cite": "John Updike",
      "quote": "Mars has long exerted a pull on the human imagination. The erratically moving red star in the sky was seen as sinister or violent by the ancients: The Greeks identified it with Ares, the god of war; the Babylonians named it after Nergal, god of the underworld. To the ancient Chinese, it was Ying-huo, the fire planet."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Anonymous",
      "quote": "Mars is the only known planet inhabited solely by robot."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Buzz Aldrin",
      "quote": "Mars could very well be a staging location for the resources of the asteroid belt. We have to learn how to get a payback somewhere, but it's beyond Mars that the real payoff will come from minerals."

    {
      "cite": "Elon Musk",
      "quote": "Mars is the only place in the solar system where it's possible for life to become multi-planetarian."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Buzz Aldrin",
      "quote": "Mars is far more attractive as an outpost colony for earthlings than the moon is."
    },
    {
      "cite": "J. Stephen Hartsfield",
      "quote": "Some day people will travel to Mars. It will be a long trip, but fun. This will be a big step for mankind. We would be able to find out if there was life on this planet. It probably will look like a red desert."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Jim Lovell",
      "quote": "Mars is a long ways away. The moon is only 240,000 miles, but Mars is in the millions. It's too risky without spending more time going to the moon."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Steven Squyres",
      "quote": "The thing that sets Mars apart is that it is the one planet that is enough like Earth that you can imagine life possibly once having taken hold there."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Buzz Aldrin",
      "quote": "Mars has been flown by, orbited, smacked into, radar inspected, and rocketed onto, as well as bounced upon, rolled over, shoveled, drilled into, baked, and even laser blasted."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Dan Quayle",
      "quote": "Mars is essentially in the same orbit Mars is somewhat the same distance from the Sun, which is very important. We have seen pictures where there are canals, we believe, and water. If there is water, that means there is oxygen. If oxygen, that means we can breathe."
