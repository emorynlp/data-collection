      "cite": "Richard Corliss",
      "quote": "Texting has reduced the number of waste words, but it has also exposed a black hole of ignorance about traditional - what a cranky guy would call correct \u00e2\u20ac\u201c grammar."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Lynne Truss",
      "quote": "Texting is a fundamentally sneaky form of communication, which we should despise, but it is such a boon we don't care. We are all sneaks now."

      "cite": "John H. McWhorter",

    },
    {
      "cite": "Lynne Truss",
      "quote": "Texting is a supremely secretive medium of communication \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it's like passing a note \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this means we should be very careful what we use it for."

    {
      "cite": "John Humphrys",
      "quote": "It is the relentless onward march of the texters, the SMS (Short Message Service) vandals who are doing to our language what Genghis Khan did to his neighbours 800 years ago. They are destroying it: pillaging our punctuation; savaging our sentences; raping our vocabulary. And they must be stopped."

    {
      "cite": "Bill O'Reilly",
      "quote": "Texting is addicting. Once you get emotionally involved with constant outside stimulation assaulting your brain, it is hard to stop looking at your machine every two minutes. Without rapid fire words appearing on a screen, you feel bored, not part of the action."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Merlin Mann",

      "quote": "A frequent exchange of text messages is not a relationship. It's not even a pen-pal."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Ashton Kutcher",
      "quote": "There is some argument about who actually invented text messaging, but I think it's safe to say it was a man. Multiple studies have shown that the average man uses about half as many words per day as women, thus text messaging. It eliminates hellos and goodbyes and cuts right to the chase."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Danielle Steel",
      "quote": "People have entire relationships via text message now, but I am not partial to texting. I need context, nuance and the warmth and tone that can only come from a human voice."

    {
      "cite": "Douglas Rushkoff",
      "quote": "Your next SMS will probably be around longer, and remain more legible, than your tombstone. For, unlike your tombstone or even your mortal coil, your texts may be worth something."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Greg Giraldo",
      "quote": "How many of you text message? It's a great way of not communicating."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Nick Cave",
      "quote": "Texting is apocalyptic on some level. It's a reduction of things."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Aziz Ansari",
      "quote": "The interesting thing about text is that, as a medium, it separates you from the person you are speaking with, so you can act differently from how you would in person or even on the phone."

    {
      "cite": "Jenna Wortham",
      "quote": "Oceans of emotion can be transmitted through a text message, an emoji sequence, and a winking semicolon, but humans are hardwired to respond to visuals."
