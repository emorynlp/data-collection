      "cite": "Todd M. Compton",
      "quote": "It is one of the great ironies of Mormon history that Smith, who set the polygamous movement in motion, never experienced it in practical terms. He was content to marry the teenage women who lived in his home and then let them depart when Emma objected. And he was content to let his polyandrous wives live with their first husbands, so he never bore the responsibility of providing for them, financially or emotionally, on a day-to-day basis."

      "quote": "A Mormon knows that the promises of God are true, and He said that all will be tried; realizing these things the Latter-day Saints will acknowledge their Maker not only in blessings but also in tribulations."

    {
      "cite": "Mary Douglas",
      "quote": "Mormons... are so strong, they can handle wealth, they are confident. I think it is because they are not bogged down by rules for equality, but have a firmly defined system of relative status and responsible command."

    {
      "cite": "Shana Alexander",

      "quote": "When our lives are congruent with the Lord\u2019s will, we are empowered spiritually. Remember what Joseph Smith was taught in Liberty Jail? If we let \u2018virtue garnish [our] thoughts unceasingly; then shall [our] confidence wax strong in the presence of God\u2019 (D&C 121:45)."
