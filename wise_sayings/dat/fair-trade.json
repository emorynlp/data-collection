      "cite": "Medea Benjamin",
      "quote": "It hit me very early on that something was terribly wrong, that I would see silos full of food and supermarkets full of food, and kids starving.

      "quote": "Fair Trade is a market-based, entrepreneurial response to business as usual: it helps third-word farmers developing direct market access as well as the organizational and management capacity to add value to their products and take them directly to the global market. Direct trade, a fair price, access to capital and local capacity-building, which are the core strategies of this model, have been successfully building farmers' incomes and self-reliance for more than 50 years."

      "cite": "Edinson Cabana Zapata",
      "quote": "With Fair Trade we have an incentive to invest in social programs that benefit producers and the community. We also receive higher incomes to sustain ourselves.
