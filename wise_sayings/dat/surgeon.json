      "cite": "Mehmet Oz",
      "quote": "As a surgeon you have to have a controlled arrogance. If it's uncontrolled, you kill people, but you have to be pretty arrogant to saw through a person's chest, take out their heart and believe you can fix it. Then, when you succeed and the patient survives, you pray, because it's only by the grace of God that you get there."

      "cite": "Charles Darwin",
      "quote": "The surgeon may harden himself whilst performing an operation, for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with an overwhelming present evil.\u00c2"

      "cite": "Reginald Pound",
      "quote": "A surgeon should give as little pain as possible while he is treating the patient, and no pain at all when he charges his fee."

    {
      "cite": "Stanley O. Hoerr",
      "quote": "The surgeon is a man of action. By temperament and by training he prefers to serve the sick by operating on them, and he inwardly commiserates with a patient so unfortunate as to have a disease not suited to surgical treatment. Young surgeons, busy mastering the technicalities of the art, are particularly alert to seize every legitimate opportunity to practice technical maneuvers, the more complicated the better.\u00c2"

    {
      "cite": "Donald B. Effler",
      "quote": "To be great, a surgeon must have a fierce determination to be the leader in his field. He must have a driving ego, a hunger beyond money. He must have a passion for perfectionism. He is like the actor who wants his name in lights.\u00c2"

      "cite": "Helen Keller",
      "quote": "True teaching cannot be learned from text-books any more than a surgeon can acquire his skill by reading about surgery."

    {
      "cite": "Abraham Verghese",
      "quote": "To be a good surgeon, you need to commit to being a good surgeon. It's as simple as that. You need to be meticulous in the small things, not just in the operating room, but outside. A good surgeon would want to redo this knot."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Abraham Verghese",
      "quote": "What made someone a real surgeon. I asked. Ghosh didn't hesitate: \"Passion for his craft ... and skill, dexterity. His hands were always 'quiet'. I mean he had no wasted movements, no dramatic gestures."

    {
      "cite": "Diana Gabaldon",
      "quote": "A trained surgeon is also a potential killer, and an important bit of the training lies in accepting the fact. Your intent is entirely benign - or at least you hope so - but your are laying violent hands on someone, and you must be ruthless in order to do it effectively. And sometimes the person under your hands will die, and knowing that . . . you do it anyway"
