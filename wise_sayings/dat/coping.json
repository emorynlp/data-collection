    },
    {
      "cite": "Julia Samuel",
      "quote": "If you ignore grief and push it down, you can live and you can even function, but you will live a very narrow emotional life because you are using so much emotional energy to cope. Everything in your psyche will be squashed down, and that means small things can trigger a much bigger kind of effect. The fact is, you have to do the work of grieving. You have to let it run its course. Pain is the agent of change; pain is what allows you to change, it\u2019s what enables you to reach a new reality."

      "cite": "Julia Samuel",
      "quote": "You have to have time when you grieve, and time when you have a break from the grief. You can create circumstances where you grieve, and circumstances where you move on."
