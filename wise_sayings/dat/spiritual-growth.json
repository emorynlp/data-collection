      "cite": "Sinclair B. Ferguson",
      "quote": "No one enjoys being cross-examined, or accused of having something wrong in their lives.

He uses Scripture to do this... We cannot reach our destination if we are travelling in the wrong direction."

    {
      "cite": "A. W. Tozer",
      "quote": "The stiff and wooden quality about our religious lives is a result of our lack of holy desire. Complacency is a deadly foe of all spiritual growth. Acute desire must be present or there will be no manifestation of Christ to His people."

      "cite": "Frederick William Robertson",
      "quote": "It is not the number of books you read, nor the variety of sermons you hear, nor the amount of religious conversation in which you mix, but it is the frequency and earnestness with which you meditate on these things till the truth in them becomes your own and part of your being, that ensures your growth."

    {
      "cite": "David A. Bednar",
      "quote": "The gospel of Jesus Christ encompasses much more than avoiding, overcoming, and being cleansed from sin and the bad influences in our lives; it also essentially entails doing good, being good, and becoming better.

    {
      "cite": "Charles Stanley",
      "quote": "Adversity is not simply a tool. It is God's most effective tool for the advancement of our spiritual lives.

Once we begin to understand this, and accept it as a spiritual fact of life, adversity becomes easier to bear."
