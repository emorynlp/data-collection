      "cite": "Michelle Visage",
      "quote": "A true diva knows there\u2019s more to life than glue-on lashes and red lips. You already know\u2014or at least you know you\u2019re supposed to know\u2014that beauty comes from the inside, but to be a diva, you\u2019ve got to get to the point where you actually unquestioningly believe that. You can spend hours and a ton of money perfecting your flawless face and sick body, but if you don't have the personality or the sense of humor to back it up, then you\u2019re focusing on the wrong damn things. An ugly personality always trumps a beautiful face. Always. And anyone who doesn\u2019t know that isn\u2019t a diva. She\u2019s just an asshole with an attitude."

      "quote": "Being the kind of diva I\u2019m talking about isn\u2019t about demanding all the green M&M\u2019s be plucked from your snack bowl in your dressing room. It\u2019s about staying late, trying harder, and working whatever you\u2019ve got. My divas get shit done while staying true to who they are."

      "cite": "Diana Ross",
      "quote": "It takes a long time to get to be a diva. I mean, you got to work it."

    {
      "cite": "Kurt Hummel",
      "quote": "You are a diva. And you have been a nightmare, but you're not a diva because you're a nightmare. You're a diva because you're talented, and ambitious, and because no one else in the world can do what you . . . can do. That's what being a diva's all about. Being an original. One of a kind. So hold the nightmare, but bring the diva."
