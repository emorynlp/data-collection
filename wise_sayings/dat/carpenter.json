      "quote": "If a carpenter makes a chair that's comfortable for the person who's going to sit in it, he's done his job. If a train engineer gets a train in on time, he's going to make someone happy who's waiting at the station. And if an artist draws the kind of a picture that people are going to enjoy looking at, or he makes a visual story which people are going to enjoy reading, he's done his job."

      "quote": "The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house."

      "quote": "Woodworking matters. It's more than a pastime or hobby being a woodworker means that you know the satisfaction and pride that comes from using your hands and mind to build beautiful, functional objects, and that you're as interested in the process as the outcome. Amid the speed and chaos of the modern world, woodworking gives us a place where we can slow down, pay attention, and take the time to do things right."

      "cite": "Christopher Alexander",
      "quote": "The difference between the novice and the master is simply that the novice has not learnt, yet, how to do things in such a way that he can afford to make small mistakes. The master knows that the sequence of his actions will always allow him to cover his mistakes a little further down the line. It is this simple but essential knowledge which gives the work of a master carpenter its wonderful, smooth, relaxed, and almost unconcerned simplicity."

      "cite": "Joshua Foer",
      "quote": "Woodworking requires a completely different kind of thinking and problem-solving ability than writing. With writing, you take a set of facts and ideas, and you reason your way forward to a story that pulls them together. With woodworking, you start with an end product in mind, and reason your way backward to the raw wood."

      "cite": "Guy Clark",
      "quote": "Let us now praise a carpenter and the things that he made / And the way that he lived by the tools of his trade / I can still hear his hammer singing ten penny time / Working by the hour till the day he died / Oh he was tough as a crowbar  quick as a chisel / Fair as a plane and true as a level / He was straight as a chalkline and right as a rule / He was square with the world he took good care of his tools."

      "quote": "In an hour I go from neatness and order to a scene of seeming chaos yet I feel settled in the build of shavings at my bench and feet. In the same one hour, I\u2019ve carved and shaped the whole seat to my rocking chair, formed the two tenons connecting the back from to the front frame yet no machine or so-called power tool pollutes me, my bench nor my work area and work."

      "cite": "Bill Berry; Peter Buck; Michael Mills; Michael Stipe",
      "quote": "My carpenter's out and running about talking to the street / My pockets are out and running about / Barking in the street to tell what I have hidden there / Burn bright through the night, two pockets lead the way / Two doors to go between the wall was raised today / Raise the walls and shout its flaws, a carpenter should rest / So that when you tire of one side the other serves you best."

    {
      "cite": "Hal Michael Ketchum",
      "quote": "I build houses and barns and a birdhouse or two / Studied my blue prints and plans / I like wood that don't argue, nails that drive straight / Tools that don't skin up my hands / Tomorrow you'll find me up on some roof / Watchin' the sun play the hill / Rye in my coffee, love in my heart / Doin' what carpenters will / I'm slow but I'm steady / I prize the work more than the pay / I'm rough and I'm ready / Living the carpenter's way."
