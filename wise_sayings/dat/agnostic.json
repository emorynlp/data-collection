      "cite": "William Jennings Bryan",
      "quote": "Agnosticism is the natural attitude of the evolutionist. How can a brute mind comprehend spiritual things?"

      "cite": "Richard P. Feynman",
      "quote": "Agnostic\u00c2\u00a0for me would be trying to weasel out and sound a little nicer than I am about this."

      "cite": "Anna Julia Cooper",

      "cite": "Sydney J. Harris",
      "quote": "Agnosticism is a perfectly respectable and tenable philosophical position; it is not dogmatic and makes no pronouncements about the ultimate truths of the universe. It remains open to evidence and persuasion; lacking faith, it nevertheless does not deride faith. Atheism, on the other hand, is as unyielding and dogmatic about religious belief as true believers are about heathens. It tries to use reason to demolish a structure that is not built upon reason."

      "cite": "Julian S. Huxley",
      "quote": "We should be\u00c2\u00a0agnostic\u00c2\u00a0about those things for which there is no evidence. We should not hold beliefs merely because they gratify our desires for afterlife, immortality, heaven, hell, etc."

      "cite": "Lauren Lola",
      "quote": "I'm\u00c2\u00a0agnostic. By definition, I'm unsure of what to believe in, but I'm also borderline-capable of believing in anything and everything, or nothing at all... and I want to believe in something."

      "cite": "Herbert Spencer",
      "quote": "Agnostics are people who, like myself, confess themselves to be hopelessly ignorant concerning a variety of matters, about which metaphysicians and theologians, both orthodox and heterodox, dogmatize with the utmost confidence."

      "cite": "Stanislaw Ulam",
      "quote": "I'm an agnostic. Sometimes I muse deeply on the forces that are for me invisible. When I am almost close to the idea of God, I feel immediately estranged by the horrors of this world, which he seems to tolerate."

      "cite": "Charles Le Gai Eaton",
      "quote": "The\u00c2\u00a0agnostic\u00c2\u00a0has a very curious notion of religion. He is convinced that a man who says 'I believe in God' should at once become perfect; if this does not happen, then the believer must be a fraud and a hypocrite. He thinks that adherence to a religion is the end of the road, whereas it is in fact only the beginning of a very long and sometimes very rough road. He looks for consistency in religious people, however aware he may be of inconsistencies in himself"

      "cite": "E. Haldeman-Julius",
      "quote": "To proclaim himself an\u00c2\u00a0agnostic, while to some it might appear more respectable and cautious, would be to say in effect that he hadn't decided what to believe."

      "cite": "William Lane Craig",
      "quote": "The person who follows the pursuit of reason unflinchingly toward its end will be atheistic or, at best, agnostic."

      "cite": "Monica Bellucci",
      "quote": "I am an agnostic, even though I respect and am interested in all religions. If there's something I believe in, it's a mysterious energy; the one that fills the oceans during tides, the one that unites nature and beings."

    {
      "cite": "Del Shores",
      "quote": "I consider myself a religious person, but when it comes to God and faith, I don't know. I guess that means I'm agnostic."

      "cite": "Clarence Darrow",

      "cite": "Jorge Luis Borges",
      "quote": "Being an\u00c2\u00a0agnostic\u00c2\u00a0means all things are possible, even God, even the Holy Trinity. This world is so strange that anything may happen, or may not happen. Being an\u00c2\u00a0agnostic\u00c2\u00a0makes me live in a larger, a more fantastic kind of world, almost uncanny. It makes me more tolerant."

      "quote": "Don't be an agnostic. Be something."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Stephen Batchelor",
      "quote": "Agnosticism is no excuse for indecision. If anything, it is a catalyst for action; for in shifting concern away from a future life and back to the present, it demands an ethics of empathy rather than a metaphysics of fear and hope."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Alan Wilson Watts",
      "quote": "The agnostic, the skeptic, is neurotic, but this does not imply a false philosophy; it implies the discovery of facts to which he does not know how to adapt himself. The intellectual who tries to escape from neurosis by escaping from the facts is merely acting on the principle that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153where ignorance is bliss, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctis folly to be wise."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Clarence Darrow",
      "quote": "I do not consider it an insult, but rather a compliment to be called an agnostic. I do not pretend to\u00c2\u00a0know\u00c2\u00a0where many ignorant men are sure \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that is all that agnosticism means."
