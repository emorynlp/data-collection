      "quote": "Seafood has always been a huge part of Massachusetts. I feel that the farm-to-table movement has highlighted the efforts put out by the fishermen and all their hard work. Fish is very seasonal, too, so it plays a big part not only getting the best, but the first of the seasonal catch. Customers are becoming very well educated about the product, so they understand and read menus that highlight that great product. As long as the chefs have a close relationship with their fishermen, it can only help to continue innovation and the ability for chefs to show off the best."
