The universe has no fixed agenda. Once you make any decision, it works around that decision. There is no right or wrong, only a series of possibilities that shift with each thought, feeling, and action that you experience.  If this sounds too mystical, refer again to the body. Every significant vital sign\u2014body temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption, hormone level, brain activity, and so on\u2014alters the moment you decide to do anything\u2026 decisions are signals telling your body, mind, and environment to move in a certain direction."
