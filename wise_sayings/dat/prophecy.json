    },
    {
      "cite": "Bishop Newton",
      "quote": "Prophecy is history anticipated and contracted: while history is prophecy accomplished and dilated."

    {
      "cite": "Robert K. Merton",
      "quote": "The self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the beginning, a false definition of the situation evoking a new behavior which makes the originally false conception come true. The specious validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Jane Kramer",
      "quote": "Prophecy today is hardly the romantic business that it used to be. The old tools of the trade, like the sword, the hair shirt, and the long fast in the wilderness, have given way to more contemporary, mundane instruments of doom --the book, the picket and the petition, the sit-in at City Hall."

    {
      "cite": "Benjamin Cardozo",
      "quote": "Prophecy, however honest, is generally a poor substitute for experience."

      "cite": "Robert Jordan",
      "quote": "Prophecy is most dangerous when you try to make it happen... The Pattern weaves itself around you, but when you try to weave it, even you cannot hold it."

      "cite": "Joel A. Barker",
      "quote": "The ultimate function of prophecy is not to tell the future, but to make it. Your successful past will block your visions of the future."
