      "cite": "Joni Mitchell",
      "quote": "You have this mounting aggressive ignorance with the rabbit's foot of their particular religion. You don't really have any kind of spiritual law, just a kind of a rabid mental illness. The songs are a little slice of life."

      "cite": "Beverly Jones",
      "quote": "Romance, like the rabbit at the dog track, is the elusive, fake, and never attained reward which, for the benefit and amusement of our masters, keeps us running and thinking in safe circles."

    {
      "cite": "Richard Adams",
      "quote": "Rabbits (says Mr. Lockley) are like human beings in many ways. One of these is certainly their staunch ability to withstand disaster and to let the stream of their life carry them along, past reaches of terror and loss. They have a certain quality which it would not be accurate to describe as callousness or indifference. It is, rather, a blessedly circumscribed imagination and an intuitive feeling that Life is Now."

    },
    {
      "cite": "Black Elk",
      "quote": "Also put rabbit skins on their arms and legs, for the rabbit represents humility, because he is quiet and soft and not self-asserting \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a quality which we must all possess when we go to the center of the world."

    {
      "cite": "Siegfried Fred Singer",
      "quote": "Dabbling in astrology is like carrying a lucky rabbit's foot as an omen of good luck which costs us very little and might have some beneficial effects."

      "cite": "Thiruvalluvar",
      "quote": "Better the arrow that missed the lion than the one that killed a rabbit."

    {
      "cite": "Kit Williams",
      "quote": "The rabbit is significant in that the handle on the original South Pointing Chariot was carved in the form of a rabbit. Because the handle extended out front it meant that wherever the rabbit went the chariot had to follow."

    {
      "cite": "Arthur Brisbane",

      "cite": "Matthew Scully",
      "quote": "My point is that when you look at a rabbit and can see only a pest, or vermin, or a meal, or a commodity, or a laboratory subject, you aren't seeing the rabbit anymore. You are seeing only yourself and the schemes and appetites we bring to the world-seeing, come to think of it, like an animal instead of as a moral being with moral vision."

    {
      "cite": "John Steinbeck",
      "quote": "Ideas are like rabbits. You get a couple and learn how to handle them, and pretty soon you have a dozen."

      "cite": "Dave Hunt",
      "quote": "One might just as well trust in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good luck\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of a rabbit's foot as to hope for spiritual benefit from a Catholic scapular, medal, crucifix, or relic of an alleged \u00e2\u20ac\u0153saint.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d"
    },
    {
      "cite": "Barbara Kingsolver",
      "quote": "People's dreams are made out of what they do all day. The same way a dog that runs after rabbits will dream of rabbits. It's what you do that makes your soul, not the other way around."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Anton Chekhov",
      "quote": "I don't know why one can't chase two rabbits at the same time, even in the literal sense of those words. If you have the hounds, go ahead and pursue."
    },
    {
      "cite": "Kenneth Kaunda",
      "quote": "Some people draw a comforting distinction between force and violence. I refuse to cloud the issue by such word-play. The power which establishes a state is violence; the power which maintains it is violence; the power which eventually overthrows it is violence. Call an elephant a rabbit only if it gives you comfort to feel that you are about to be trampled to death by a rabbit."

      "cite": "Mike Krieger",
      "quote": "You can't start a product simply by building it. You have to know why you're building it, and you might go down the wrong rabbit hole, waste time, and confuse things. Spending long afternoons with a sketchbook or talking through your ideas with other people can save a year in software development later on."

      "quote": "I'll give you three guesses, Rabbit. Digging holes in the ground? Wrong. Leaping from branch to branch of a young oak tree? Wrong. Waiting for somebody to help me out of the river? Right. Give Rabbit time, and he'll always get the answer."
