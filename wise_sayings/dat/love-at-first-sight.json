      "cite": "William Hazlitt",
      "quote": "Love at first sight is only realizing an imagination that has always haunted us; or meeting with a face, a figure, or cast of expression in perfection that we have seen and admired in a less degree or in less favorable circumstances a hundred times before."

    {
      "cite": "Tablo",
      "quote": "People believe those fairytales about falling in love at first sight at the bus, subway, or at the streets. But it doesn't make sense how they'd laugh at the ones who fell in love at first sight through TV screens. Loving a celebrity IS a type of love. Love is fair to everyone."

    {
      "cite": "Anonymous",
      "quote": "Love at first sight becomes truly remarkable when people have been looking at each other for years and realize that they love each other all along."
