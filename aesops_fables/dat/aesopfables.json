At first he turned to flee, but finding that the Lion did not pursue him, he turned back and went up to him. As he came near, the Lion put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and Androcles found that a huge thorn had got into it, and was causing all the pain. He pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the Lion, who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog. Then the Lion took Androcles to his cave, and every day used to bring him meat from which to live. But shortly afterwards both Androcles and the Lion were captured, and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the Lion, after the latter had been kept without food for several days. The Emperor and all his Court came to see the spectacle, and Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena. Soon the Lion was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim. But as soon as he came near to Androcles he recognised his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands like a friendly dog. The Emperor, surprised at this, summoned Androcles to him, who told him the whole story. Whereupon the slave was pardoned and freed, and the Lion let loose to his native forest.",

When you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life.\" No sooner said than done: the two mice set off for the town and arrived at the Town Mouse's residence late at night. \"You will want some refreshment after our long journey,\" said the polite Town Mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining-room. There they found the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes and all that was nice. Suddenly they heard growling and barking. \"What is that?\" said the Country Mouse. \"It is only the dogs of the house,\" answered the other. \"Only!\" said the Country Mouse. \"I do not like that music at my dinner.\" Just at that moment the door flew open, in came two huge mastiffs, and the two mice had to scamper down and run off. \"Good-bye, Cousin,\" said the Country Mouse, \"What! going so soon?\" said the other. \"Yes,\" he replied;",
